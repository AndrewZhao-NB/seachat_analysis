bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 16:38:19.420545," Great! To set up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your RedTrack account and click 'Traffic channels.'
2. Click '+ NEW FROM TEMPLATE' and search for NewsBreak.
3. Once you click 'Add,' the NewsBreak Template should open up with the fields populated.
4. Use the s2s URL: `https://business.newsbreak.com/tracking/attribute?callback={ref_id}&event_type={REPLACE}`
5. Replace `{REPLACE}` with your actual conversion event, like `complete_payment`.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 16:38:55.806178," It looks like your postback links are being sent correctly, as indicated by the `{code=0}` in the response, which typically means success. However, the `msg` field is empty, which might suggest that there are no additional messages or errors.

To ensure everything is working smoothly:
1. Double-check that the event types (`initiate_checkout` and `complete_payment`) are correctly set up in your NewsBreak ad account.
2. Verify that any required parameters, like `nb_value`, are included and correctly formatted.
3. Make sure your conversion events are properly configured on both RedTrack and NewsBreak.

If everything seems correct but you're still facing issues, you might want to test the conversion flow end-to-end to ensure data is being tracked accurately.
