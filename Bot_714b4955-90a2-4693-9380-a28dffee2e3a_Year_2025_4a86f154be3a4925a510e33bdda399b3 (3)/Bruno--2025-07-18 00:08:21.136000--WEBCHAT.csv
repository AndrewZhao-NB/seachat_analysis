bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-18 00:10:12.843058," Sure, I can help with that! To optimize your campaign, you can start by reviewing the ad performance in the Reporting tab. Look for insights on what works and what doesn't. You can refine your audience targeting, schedule ads during peak hours, and invest in visually compelling ad content. Additionally, running A/B tests to identify which ad variations perform best is a great strategy before allocating more budget.
