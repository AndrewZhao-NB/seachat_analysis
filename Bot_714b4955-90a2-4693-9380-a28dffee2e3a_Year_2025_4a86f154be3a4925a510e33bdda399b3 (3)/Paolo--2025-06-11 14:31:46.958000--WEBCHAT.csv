The event is already whitelisted, and when I test the postback using RedTrack’s S2S tool, the result returns “successful.”

However, when I try to save the dataset in the UI, I get this error:

“Invalid Operation. Please reach out to your Account Manager for more information.”

Can you please check if Postback tracking is fully enabled on my account or if there’s a backend restriction preventing me from saving the setup?

Thanks!",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-11 14:34:30.747575," It sounds like you're having trouble saving your Postback setup for your ClickBank campaign via RedTrack. Since the event test returned ""successful,"" it seems the tracking is set up correctly on RedTrack's side. However, the error message suggests there might be a restriction or issue on NewsBreak's backend.

Unfortunately, I can't directly check backend restrictions or enable Postback tracking on your account. I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of the error message and your account information. They will be able to investigate further and assist you with resolving this issue.
