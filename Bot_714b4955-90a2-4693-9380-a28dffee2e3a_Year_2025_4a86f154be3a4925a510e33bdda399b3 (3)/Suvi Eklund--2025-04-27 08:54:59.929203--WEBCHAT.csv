bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-27 08:56:05.318202," Let's try to figure out why your ad isn't delivering even though it's active. Could you provide me with some additional details? Specifically, I'd like to know:
- The campaign start date
- The bidding type you're using
- Your targeting or budget settings
- Any recent changes you've made in the last 72 hours
Once I have this information, I can help you troubleshoot further!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-29 14:48:22.475182," It sounds like you might have been billed for ad spend on your NewsBreak Ad Manager account. Each ad account has its own billing setup, and charges are typically based on the budget and spend of your active campaigns. If you need more specific details about this charge, I recommend checking your billing section in the Ad Manager or contacting our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-29 14:49:33.792004," Ad credits are used as a form of payment for ads, and they should be applied before any charges to your primary payment method. If you have ad credits in your account, they will be used first for your ad spend. However, if your ad spend exceeds the amount of ad credits available, additional costs may be charged to your stored payment method. If you believe there was an error with the billing, please reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further investigation.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-02 15:28:55.826247," Yes, the $10 charge is a temporary card authorization fee. If you run ads, this amount goes towards your advertising budget. If you don't run ads, it will be fully refunded after 7 days if not captured within this time. Stripe cancels the payment and releases the funds.",{}
