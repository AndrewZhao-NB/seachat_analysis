I've followed the instructions on the article, installed the pixel in my header of my store and created the customer event.

I've put through a test purchase and cannot get past the pixel test screen.

While running the shopify pixel test, it shows the pixel is opn all of my pages.

Please help. Thanks!",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-14 21:14:56.865177," It sounds like you've done a great job setting up the pixel so far! Let's troubleshoot this together. First, ensure that the custom event is correctly configured in Shopify and that it fires during the test purchase. You can use Shopify's 'Test' feature to verify if the event triggers correctly.
If the pixel is showing on all pages but not firing for the test purchase, double-check that the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place (e.g., checkout completed).
If you've verified these steps and it's still not working, you might want to reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your setup for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-15 02:06:11.272706," For app installs, verticals that typically perform well include gaming, e-commerce, finance, and lifestyle apps. These categories often have a broad audience and can benefit from targeted advertising strategies. If you're looking to optimize your campaigns for app installs, consider focusing on these verticals and tailoring your ad content to appeal to the specific interests of users within these categories.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-10 03:57:24.723511," Let's tackle your questions one by one:

1. **Recommended Starting Budget for Lead Generation Campaign:** It's generally recommended to start with a budget that aligns with your CPA goals. While 10x payout/day can be a rule of thumb, it's important to consider the learning phase and adjust based on performance.

2. **Recommended Starting Budget for eCommerce Campaign:** Starting with 5x AOV/day can be a solid benchmark, but again, it depends on your specific goals and the learning phase of the campaign.

3. **Optimal Campaign Structure:** It's suggested to create 2-3 ad sets under one campaign. Testing 3-5 ads per ad set is recommended, but if your budget is below $200, then 2-3 creatives per ad set might be more suitable.

4. **Mixing Vertical and Horizontal Images:** Mixing formats within the same ad set can be done, but consistency in format might lead to better performance as it avoids auto-cropping or placement adjustments that could affect engagement.
