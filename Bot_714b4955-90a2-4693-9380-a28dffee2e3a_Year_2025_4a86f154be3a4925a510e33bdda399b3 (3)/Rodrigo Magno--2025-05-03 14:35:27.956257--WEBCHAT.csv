bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 03:13:11.483036," It sounds like there might be an issue with the Click ID parameter in your ClickBank tracking URL. To ensure proper tracking, you need to use the parameter ""tid"" in your URL to pass through the click ID. Here's a quick guide on how to set it up:
1. Make sure your ClickBank tracking URL includes the parameter `tid=__CALLBACK_PARAM__`.
2. For example, your URL should look something like this: `https://hop.clickbank.net/?vendor=[seller account nickname]&affiliate=[affiliate account nickname]&lid=6100&tid=__CALLBACK_PARAM__`.
3. If you're using a custom landing page, ensure that the Click ID is passed through all redirects to the landing page.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to our article on setting up a ClickBank Postback on NewsBreak: [How to set up a ClickBank Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23746617571341-How-to-set-up-a-ClickBank-Postback-on-NewsBreak).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 14:52:57.253185," If you've already made the changes and the TID is still not showing up, let's double-check a few things:
1. Ensure that the parameter `tid=__CALLBACK_PARAM__` is correctly included in your ClickBank tracking URL.
2. Verify that your custom landing page or any redirects are correctly passing the Click ID to ClickBank.
3. Make sure you have tested the integration using NewsBreak's Event Testing Tool by selecting ""Create/Test Web Event"" and choosing ""Postback"" as your event tracking type.
4. If you haven't done so, click ""TEST IPN"" twice for verification in ClickBank's settings.
