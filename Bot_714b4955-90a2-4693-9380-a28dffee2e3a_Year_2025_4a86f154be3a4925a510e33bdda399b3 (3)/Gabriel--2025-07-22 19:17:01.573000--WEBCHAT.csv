bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 19:38:26.436622," When launching your first campaign on NewsBreak, it's generally recommended to start with broad targeting. This means selecting 'unlimited' for your targeting options to cast a wider net and help identify users most likely to convert. As for the ideal bid in the nutraceutical market, it can vary based on competition and specific goals. I suggest starting with a competitive bid based on your budget and adjusting as you gather performance data. For more detailed guidance, you can check out our article on creating your first ad: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 19:39:48.666215," If your campaign isn't spending, there are a few things you can check. First, ensure that the launch date and time are set correctly at the ad set level, as Ad Manager uses PST/military time. A low bid could also be a factor, so consider increasing it to be more competitive. Additionally, make sure your targeting isn't too narrow and that your daily budget is sufficient to allow for optimal performance. For more tips on troubleshooting this issue, you can refer to our FAQ: [Campaigns not spending?](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18088532505485-Campaigns-not-spending-FAQ).",{}
