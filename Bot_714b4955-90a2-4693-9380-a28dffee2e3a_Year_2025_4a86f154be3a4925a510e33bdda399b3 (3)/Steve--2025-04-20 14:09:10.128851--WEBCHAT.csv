bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 22:35:38.462295," It sounds like there might be an issue with the integration between ClickBank and NewsBreak. Let's go through the setup steps to ensure everything is configured correctly. 
1. Make sure you are using ClickBank Version 8.0, as Version 7.0 is no longer supported.
2. Log in to your ClickBank account and navigate to 'Vendor Settings' > 'My Site'.
3. In the 'Advanced Tool' section, click 'Edit' and ensure that you have requested access to the Instant Notification URL.
4. Set the Secret Key to 'MONETIZENEWS' and use the following Instant Notification URL: `https://business.newsbreak.com/tracking/clickbank`.
5. Don't forget to click 'TEST IPN' twice for verification and save your changes.
6. Finally, create and test your conversion flow end-to-end in NewsBreak's Event Testing Tool by selecting 'Create/Test Web Event'.
