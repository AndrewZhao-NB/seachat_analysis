bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-04 20:25:36.932177," Let's troubleshoot your conversion tracking issue in Shopify. First, ensure that the NewsBreak Pixel is correctly installed on your Shopify store. You can follow these steps:

1. Log into your Shopify account and navigate to Online Store > Themes.
2. Identify your active theme, click Actions, and choose Edit code.
3. Find and edit the file under the Layout section (theme.liquid).
4. Paste the NewsBreak Pixel Base Code just before the </head> tag in the theme.liquid file.
5. Save the changes.

If your conversion event involves actions like adding items to the cart or making a purchase, you'll need additional tracking for those specific events.

For testing:
- Use Shopify's 'Test' feature to load the event.
- For Purchase/complete_payment events, you will need to make a purchase for the test to complete.

If you're still having trouble, please check if your tracking platform is recording clicks but not conversions. If it records conversions but not in NewsBreak, grab the click ID and timestamp from your tracking platform and email adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-04 20:28:17.385811," To address the pixel issue, let's ensure that the NewsBreak Pixel is properly set up on your Shopify store. Here are some steps to follow:

1. **Verify Installation**: Make sure the pixel code is correctly placed in your Shopify theme's liquid file, just before the closing </head> tag.

2. **Event Tracking**: Confirm that specific events like 'Add to Cart' or 'Purchase' are being tracked. You might need to add additional event codes for these actions.

3. **Testing**: Use Shopify's test feature to simulate events and check if they are recorded.

4. **Check Clicks and Conversions**: Ensure your tracking platform records clicks and conversions accurately. If conversions aren't showing in NewsBreak, note down the click ID and timestamp from your tracking platform.

2. **Simulate the Event**: Perform the action that should trigger the conversion pixel, such as adding an item to the cart or completing a purchase.

3. **Verify Configuration in Shopify**: Make sure that the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify and test it there as well.

4. **Test in NewsBreak**: Test the event in NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
