bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-05 19:30:34.059142," It seems like the option to add funds might not be available for your account yet. This could be due to certain requirements not being met. To enable the ad credit functionality, your account needs to:
1. Complete and pass business verification.
2. Accumulate over $5,000 in spend.
3. Establish a relationship with an Account Manager (AM), who can then request the ad credit functionality to be enabled for you.
