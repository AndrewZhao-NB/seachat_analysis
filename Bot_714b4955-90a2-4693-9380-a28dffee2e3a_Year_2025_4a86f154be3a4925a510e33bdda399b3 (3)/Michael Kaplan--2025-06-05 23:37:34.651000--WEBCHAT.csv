I can assure you it is. It doesn't load if the user is outside the US, which maybe the people checking this stuff are not in the US. Can someone please help me? Thanks.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-05 23:38:34.775521," Hi there! I'm sorry to hear about the trouble with your campaign. NewsBreak is a US-only traffic source, so it's important that your landing page works for users within the US. If you're confident that the landing page is functioning correctly for US users, I recommend reaching out to our Ad Support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com. They can provide more specific guidance and help resolve this issue. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",{}
