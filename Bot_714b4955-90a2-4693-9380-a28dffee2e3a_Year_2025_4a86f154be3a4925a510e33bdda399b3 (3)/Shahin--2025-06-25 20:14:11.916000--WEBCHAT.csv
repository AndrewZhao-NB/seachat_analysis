bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-25 20:15:31.239167," Thanks for letting me know you're using RedTrack. To troubleshoot your pixel issue, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the base pixel code is correctly added to your landing page URL.
2. Verify that the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel, such as simulating a purchase if it's a complete_payment event.
4. Check if the pixel fires correctly after performing these actions.

If you continue to experience issues, I recommend reviewing RedTrack's specific setup instructions or contacting adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to our Event Tracking Debugging Steps article.",{}
