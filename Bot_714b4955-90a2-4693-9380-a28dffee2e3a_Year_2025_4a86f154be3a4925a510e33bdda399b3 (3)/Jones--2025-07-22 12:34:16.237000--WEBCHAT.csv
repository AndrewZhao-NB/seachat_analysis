The ""Warning: No active ad sets"" status means that your campaign is currently not running any ads because there are no active ad sets associated with it. 

To resolve this, you will need to:

1. **Create an Ad Set:** You'll need to set up at least one active ad set under your campaign. 
2. **Check Ad Set Settings:** Ensure your ad sets meet all requirements and are properly configured.

Once you have at least one active ad set, the warning should change, and your campaign will be able to run ads.",

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 12:04:47.418006," To set up an ad set, you'll need to access the Ad Management section of your NewsBreak account. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Access Ad Management:** Log into your NewsBreak account and navigate to the Ad Management section.
2. **Create Campaign:** Click 'Create Campaign' and choose your campaign objective.
3. **Set Up Ad Set:** Within the campaign setup, you'll find options to create ad sets. Configure your targeting, budget, and schedule here.
4. **Save Settings:** Make sure to save your settings to activate the ad set.

Yes, you are correct. In your screenshot, ""Ad sets"" refers to a collection of ads within a campaign. The warning indicates that the ad set ""ons001"" is not currently set up to deliver ads because it requires an event to be defined for delivery, such as a conversion event.

To resolve this:

1. **Edit Ad Set:** Click on the ""Edit"" button for the ad set.
