I followed the instructions and on the test on the clickbank side it is successful but on the newsbreak side it is endlessly trying to generate a code,{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-13 15:47:36.948644," It sounds like you're having trouble with the NewsBreak side of your ClickBank integration. Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot this:

1. **Double-check the Instant Notification URL**: Make sure that the Instant Notification URL is correctly set to `https://business.newsbreak.com/tracking/clickbank` in your ClickBank account.

2. **Verify the Secret Key**: Ensure that the Secret Key is set to `MONETIZENEWS` in your ClickBank settings.

3. **Test IPN**: You should click ""TEST IPN"" twice for verification on ClickBank's side.

4. **Check Event Testing Tool**: In NewsBreak, make sure you are using the Event Testing Tool correctly by selecting ""Create/Test Web Event"" and following all instructions carefully.

5. **Custom Landing Page**: If you're using a custom landing page, ensure that the Click ID is passed through all redirects to accurately track clicks.

If you've checked all these and it's still not working, there might be an issue with how the data is being passed between platforms. You can refer to this [ClickBank Postback Integration Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23746617571341-How-to-set-up-a-ClickBank-Postback-on-NewsBreak) for more detailed instructions.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-13 15:48:03.765636," It seems like the sales tracking code is taking longer than expected to test. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes, simply refreshing the page can resolve any temporary glitches.

2. **Check Network Connection**: Ensure that your internet connection is stable, as a weak connection might cause delays.

3. **Re-test the IPN**: Go back to ClickBank and click ""TEST IPN"" again to ensure that the notification is being sent correctly.

4. **Clear Cache and Cookies**: Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, then attempt the test again.

5. **Review Setup Steps**: Double-check all setup steps in both ClickBank and NewsBreak to ensure everything is configured correctly.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be best to contact support at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
