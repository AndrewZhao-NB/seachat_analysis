bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-03 22:34:56.948125," Thanks for confirming. Since you've followed the guide and are still experiencing issues, let's try a few troubleshooting steps to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here are some things to check:
1. **Base Pixel Code**: Ensure the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. **Custom Pixel Code**: Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page (where the user action takes place).
3. **Event Trigger**: Perform the action that should trigger the pixel (e.g., simulate purchasing a product if the event type is complete_payment).
4. **Shopify Configuration**: Verify that the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify.
5. **Testing**: Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
If these steps don't resolve your issue, I recommend contacting our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details about your setup and any error messages you're receiving.
For more detailed troubleshooting steps, you can refer to this guide: [Pixel and Postback Debugging Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23053537846669-Introduction-to-Multi-Event-Tracking).",{}
