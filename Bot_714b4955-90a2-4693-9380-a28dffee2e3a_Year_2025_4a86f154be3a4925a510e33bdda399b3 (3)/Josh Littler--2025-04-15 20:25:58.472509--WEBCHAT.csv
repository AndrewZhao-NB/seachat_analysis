I wanted to pick your brains about something. We have been running an ad pretty successfully thus far, however, from a data perspective, out of the leads we have done MTD, we are seeing A LOT of no answers. Customers never answering or getting back to the client. 
Those that have eventually converted into a full sale are very low credit rating users. 
The specific campaign is
ADT MARCH

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-15 20:26:40.045566," Hey Josh! Thanks for reaching out. It sounds like you're experiencing some challenges with your ADT MARCH campaign. To better understand and address the issue, could you provide more details on the targeting criteria and ad creatives you're using? Additionally, it might be helpful to review your audience settings and consider optimizing them to reach higher credit rating users. Let me know if you need guidance on how to adjust these settings or if there's anything else I can assist with!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-15 20:27:08.516386," Sure thing, Josh! To adjust your audience settings and optimize your campaign, follow these steps:
1. **Access Your Campaign**: Log in to your NewsBreak Ads account and navigate to the ADT MARCH campaign.
2. **Edit Audience Settings**: Go to the Ad Set level where you can modify the targeting criteria. Look for options related to demographics, interests, and behaviors.
3. **Target Higher Credit Rating Users**: Adjust the settings to focus on users with higher credit ratings. You might need to refine your targeting parameters or use custom audiences based on credit-related data.
4. **Review Ad Creatives**: Ensure that your ad creatives are appealing to the desired audience. Sometimes tweaking the messaging or visuals can make a significant difference.
5. **Save Changes**: Make sure to hit 'Save and Next' instead of 'Save' on the Campaign and Ad set level, unless you intend on creating a draft.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-15 20:27:47.755318," To target higher credit rating users, you can consider the following criteria:
1. **Demographics**: Focus on age groups and income levels that are more likely to have higher credit ratings. For example, targeting users aged 30-50 with higher income brackets.
2. **Interests and Behaviors**: Look for interests related to financial stability, such as investment, savings, and financial planning. You can also target users who have shown interest in premium products or services.
3. **Custom Audiences**: If you have access to data on users with higher credit ratings, create custom audiences based on this data.
4. **Lookalike Audiences**: Create lookalike audiences from your existing high-value customers who have good credit ratings.
5. **Geographic Targeting**: Focus on regions or areas known for higher average credit scores.
Adjust these settings in your Ad Set to better align with your desired audience. If you need more detailed steps on how to implement these changes, let me know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-15 20:29:56.395671," Creating a lookalike audience can help you reach new users who are similar to your best customers. Here’s how you can create a lookalike audience on NewsBreak Ads:
1. **Log In**: Log in to your NewsBreak Ads account.
2. **Navigate to Audience Management**: Go to the 'Tools' tab and select 'Audience Management'.
3. **Create Custom Audience**: If you haven't already, create a custom audience based on your high-value customers. You can do this by uploading a CSV file with user identifiers (like email addresses or device IDs) or by selecting users who have engaged with your ads.
4. **Create Lookalike Audience**: Once you have your custom audience, select the option to create a lookalike audience. The platform will use the data from your custom audience to find new users who share similar characteristics.
5. **Set Parameters**: Define the size and other parameters for your lookalike audience. You can choose how closely the new audience should match your original custom audience.
6. **Save and Apply**: Save the new lookalike audience and apply it to your ad sets.
