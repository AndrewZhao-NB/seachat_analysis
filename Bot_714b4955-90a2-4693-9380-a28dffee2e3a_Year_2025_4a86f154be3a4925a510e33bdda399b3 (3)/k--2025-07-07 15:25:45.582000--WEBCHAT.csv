bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 19:51:40.567098," It sounds like you're having trouble with the custom events in Shopify. Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot:

1. **Verify Pixel Placement**: Ensure that the pixel code is correctly placed in the `theme.liquid` file of your Shopify store.

2. **Base Pixel Check**: Since the base pixel is loading correctly, that's a good sign. Make sure that the custom event code is also placed correctly.

3. **Test Purchase**: For purchase events like `complete_payment`, you may need to perform a test purchase to validate the event.

4. **Redirects and Event Loading**: Check if the custom event loads after going through any redirects on your site.

If you've checked these and are still having issues, you might want to refer to our detailed instructions in the help center article on Event Tracking for more guidance.

Here's a link to our [Event Tracking Guidelines](#).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 20:44:57.763504," If you're not seeing the third-party publisher segment in your campaign settings, it might be due to a few reasons:

1. **Campaign Type**: Ensure that your campaign type supports third-party publisher options. Some campaign types may not have this feature available.

2. **Account Permissions**: Double-check if you have the necessary permissions to modify these settings. Sometimes, certain features are restricted based on user roles.

3. **Platform Updates**: There might be updates or changes in the platform that affect where these settings are located.

I’m currently building a platform that enables users to launch Newsbreak ad campaigns directly. During the integration, I’ve hit a roadblock regarding the  location targeting feature. 

Currently, when the user types into the location search field (e.g., 



""in""
), the UI fires an API request to your 



/autocomplete
endpoint and returns a list of 50 matched records. However, for our use case, we’d like to: 

 

Pre-fetch the complete list of available locations 
 

Store them locally or cache them
