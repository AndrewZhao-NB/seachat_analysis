bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-17 08:55:35.975089," Hi there! It sounds like there might be a glitch if your inactive Ad Set is spending money. I recommend checking the status of the Ad Set to ensure it's indeed marked as inactive. Sometimes, changes might not reflect immediately due to system delays.

For reimbursement, please submit a request to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of the issue, including any relevant screenshots or documentation. They will investigate and assist you further.

Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!",{}
