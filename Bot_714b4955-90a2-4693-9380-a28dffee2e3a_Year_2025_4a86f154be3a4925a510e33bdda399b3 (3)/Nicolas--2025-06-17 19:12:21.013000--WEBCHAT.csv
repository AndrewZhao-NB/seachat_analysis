bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-17 19:12:46.936924," Hey there! Let's figure out why your ad is showing as inactive. Could you please check if there have been any recent changes to your campaign settings, like budget or targeting? Also, let me know the start date of your campaign and the bidding type you're using. This information will help us troubleshoot the issue.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-17 19:14:06.068953," Thanks for the details! Since your campaign started yesterday and you're using Max Conversion bidding, it's likely in the learning phase. During this time, the system is analyzing performance signals to optimize your ad. This phase typically completes after around 20-30 conversions. I recommend staying patient and avoiding any major changes to your campaign settings during this period. You can check back in a few days to see if the status updates.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-17 19:15:05.363295," If you're seeing a ""warning no active ads"" message, it might be due to the learning phase not being completed yet. Ensure that your ad set is receiving enough impressions and conversions to move past this phase. You can try increasing your daily budget slightly to help gather more data quickly. If the issue persists, please reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
