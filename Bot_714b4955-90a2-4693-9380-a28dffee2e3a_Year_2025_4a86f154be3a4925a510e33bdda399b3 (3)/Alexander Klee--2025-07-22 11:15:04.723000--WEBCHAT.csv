bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 11:16:52.503682," If your card payment failed even though you have verified it and have enough funds, I recommend contacting your bank to resolve the payment issue. Alternatively, you can add a different payment method. If you choose to update your account with a different payment method, don't forget to resubmit your ads! Another short-term solution is to add ad credits to your account.",{}
