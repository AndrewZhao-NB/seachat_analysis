bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-27 16:14:20.378517," The $10 charge you're seeing is a temporary card authorization fee. This is a standard practice to verify your payment method. If you run ads, this amount will go towards your advertising budget. If you don't run any ads, it will be fully refunded. As for the $8.10 charge, it could be related to your actual ad spend. For more details on billing and charges, you can refer to our Billing Guide here: [Billing Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17821681919757-Billing-Guide). If you have further questions or need clarification, feel free to ask!",{}
