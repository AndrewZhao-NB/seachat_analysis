bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-16 14:33:52.087565," Since you're using a custom tracking setup, you can integrate a general NewsBreak Postback to track events. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add the Callback Parameter to Your Ad's Landing Page URL: Insert `__CALLBACK_PARAM__` into the landing page URL of your ad.

For more detailed instructions, please refer to this article: [How to integrate a general NewsBreak Postback](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25226963388813-How-to-integrate-a-general-NewsBreak-Postback). Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-16 14:34:36.947706," The issue with the link might be related to the placement of the `__CALLBACK_PARAM__`. Ensure that it is correctly inserted into your landing page URL as shown in the example: `callback=nvss_fa2c907daf004e74a34bebedee422d2c_1599867362386763778&event_type=complete_payment&nb_value=50`. This parameter is essential for tracking events.

If you haven't already, test the Postback integration by entering your landing page URL (including `__CALLBACK_PARAM__`) and clicking ""Go test"" to trigger your conversion event. After triggering the event, return to NewsBreak's page to see the test result.
