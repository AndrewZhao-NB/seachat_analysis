It seems you're experiencing an ""Invalid operation"" error while trying to create a new web event in your pixel tracking system. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check URL Format**: Ensure that the URL you're using for the new event is correctly formatted and doesn't contain any extra characters or spaces.

2. **Duplicate Events**: Check if an event with a similar name or configuration already exists. The tracking system might not allow duplicates.

3. **Clear Cache**: Refresh the page or clear your browser’s cache and cookies. Sometimes, cached data can cause issues with web applications.

4. **Browser Compatibility**: Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists.

5. **Script Validation**: Ensure that your tracking script is correct and follows the prescribed format. Any errors in the script can lead to operation failures.

6. **Contact Support**: Since the error message suggests reaching out to your Account Manager, consider doing that for specific guidance tailored to your account and situation.

If you've gone through these troubleshooting steps and the issue continues, reaching out to the support team will be the best course of action.",

It looks like you're running into an 'Invalid operation' error while trying to create a new web event for your pixel tracking. Here are some focused troubleshooting steps you can try to resolve this issue quickly:

1. **Name Uniqueness**: Ensure that the new event name you're trying to use is unique and not already in use. From your screenshots, it looks like you have existing events; try a different name for the new event.

2. **Check Input Fields**: Double-check all input fields when creating the new event. Ensure there's no input that may be invalid or incorrectly formatted, particularly in the URL or event type.

3. **Refresh or Re-log**: Sometimes logging out and back in or refreshing the page can clear temporary issues.

4. **Clear Browser Cache**: Clear your browser's cache and cookies to ensure you're not loading outdated data or settings.

5. **Different Browser**: Try using a different browser or device to see if the error persists.

6. **Wait and Retry**: Occasionally, systems can have temporary issues. If possible, wait a while and then try again.

7. **Contact Support**: If the error continues after trying the above steps, it’s best to contact your Account Manager or support team as suggested in the error message for more targeted help.

If you could let me know which step you tried, I can provide more targeted advice!",
