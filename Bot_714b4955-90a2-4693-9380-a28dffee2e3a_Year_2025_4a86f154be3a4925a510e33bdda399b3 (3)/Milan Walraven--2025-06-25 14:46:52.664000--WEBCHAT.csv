1. **Verify Pixel Placement**: Ensure that the pixel code is correctly placed in the `theme.liquid` file of your Shopify store.

2. **Test the Event**: Use Shopify's 'Test' feature to load and verify if the custom event fires correctly.

3. **Simulate a Purchase**: For purchase or complete_payment events, simulate a purchase to ensure that the event triggers properly.

4. **Check Event Type**: Make sure you have selected the correct event type for tracking.

If you've followed these steps and still face issues, please let me know, and we can explore further options.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-30 13:53:12.909390," If you're unable to verify the conversion even after testing, please check the following:

1. **Pixel Code Placement**: Double-check that the pixel code is correctly placed in the `theme.liquid` file within the `<head>` section.

2. **Event Configuration**: Ensure that the event is configured correctly in Shopify and NewsBreak.

3. **Simulate Actions**: For specific events like complete_payment, simulate a purchase to trigger the event.

4. **Debugging Steps**: Follow any debugging steps provided in your Shopify account or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

If these steps don't resolve your issue, please let me know!",{}
