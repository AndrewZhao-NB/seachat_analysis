bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 16:27:13.587672," Thanks for sharing the campaign start date. Since your campaign started 3 days ago, it might still be in the 'Cold Start Period.' During this phase, our system gathers crucial learnings about user behavior to identify the most likely converting audience segments. You should expect daily fluctuations, and once enough data is collected, performance will stabilize.

Could you also let me know your bidding type and any targeting or budget settings? This will help us further analyze the situation.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 16:27:45.191947," Great, you're using the Max Conversion bidding type. During the learning phase, which typically completes after around 20-30 conversions, it's important to be patient and avoid making too many changes. This is when our system is analyzing performance signals to find the best audience segments and placements.

If your campaign isn't spending as expected, consider gradually increasing your daily budget every 2-3 days by a maximum of 50% each time to help scale. Also, ensure that your targeting settings are broad enough unless you have specific restrictions.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 16:28:25.588015," With a daily budget of $50, you're in a good position to start seeing results once the learning phase is complete. If your campaign isn't spending as expected, you might want to consider increasing your budget gradually. A good rule of thumb is to increase it by no more than 50% every 2-3 days.

Additionally, ensure that your targeting settings are broad enough to allow the system to find the best audience segments. This will help optimize your campaign's performance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 16:29:34.487732," To help your ads start spending, here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Review Targeting Settings:** Ensure your targeting is broad enough to reach a wider audience. Narrow targeting can limit the potential reach and spend.

2. **Adjust Budget Gradually:** Consider increasing your daily budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days. This allows the system to adjust and optimize without causing performance fluctuations.

3. **Check Bidding Strategy:** Since you're using Max Conversions, make sure your CPA goal aligns with the budget and expected conversion rate.

4. **Monitor Learning Phase:** Be patient during the learning phase, which typically requires around 20-30 conversions to complete. Avoid making too many changes during this time.

5. **Creative Testing:** If possible, test different ad creatives to see which ones perform better and drive more engagement.

By following these steps, you should be able to improve your campaign's performance and start seeing spend on your ads.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-27 18:46:16.743068," Let's troubleshoot why your ads aren't spending. Since your bidding type is set to 'Maximize Conversions' and the campaign started 3 days ago with a daily budget of $50, it might still be in the learning phase. During this time, it's normal for performance to fluctuate or for spending to be low. I recommend monitoring the campaign for a few more days to see if it stabilizes. If you have any recent changes, try not to make further adjustments until it exits the learning phase. For more detailed guidance, you can refer to our article on 'Introduction to Maximize Conversions': [here](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/20624355375117-Introduction-to-Maximize-Conversions).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-27 18:47:12.199393," Yes, it's quite normal for a new account to experience low spending initially. This is often due to the learning phase where the system is analyzing performance signals to optimize your campaign. It typically takes around 20-30 conversions for the learning phase to complete. During this time, minimal changes should be made to avoid disrupting the process. If your ads are approved but not spending, give it a few more days and monitor its progress.
