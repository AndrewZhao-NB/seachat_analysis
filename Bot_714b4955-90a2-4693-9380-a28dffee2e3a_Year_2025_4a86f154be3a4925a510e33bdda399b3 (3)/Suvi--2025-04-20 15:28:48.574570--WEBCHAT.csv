bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 11:23:35.262784," Thanks for the information! Since your campaign start date is today, please check the launch time at the ad set level. News Break Ad Manager operates in PST/military time, so sometimes campaigns are set to start at a later time than expected. If everything looks correct and your ad is still inactive, please let me know any other details like bidding type, targeting or budget settings, and any recent changes in the last 72 hours.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 11:41:26.530714," When your ad status is 'pending,' it means that your ad is currently under review. This review process ensures that your ad complies with News Break's advertising policies and guidelines. The review typically takes a few hours, but it can sometimes take longer. If your account is new and not yet verified, this could also cause delays. If you need further assistance or if the status doesn't change after a reasonable time, please email adsupport@newsbreak.com with the subject line: Business Verification and include the following details:
- Company's full address
- Company's legal entity name
- Company's EHID or DUNS number
- Primary contact person's name
- Company's phone number
Once we receive this information, we will conduct a thorough review and update you on your account status.",{}
