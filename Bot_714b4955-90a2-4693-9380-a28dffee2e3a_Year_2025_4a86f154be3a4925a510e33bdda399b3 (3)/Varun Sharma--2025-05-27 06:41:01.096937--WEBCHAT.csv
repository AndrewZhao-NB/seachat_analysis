bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-27 06:43:30.308984," Hi there! It sounds like you're trying to add funds to your account. Currently, the ad credit functionality is not available for newly created accounts by default. To enable this feature, your account must complete and pass business verification, and accumulate over $5,000 in spend. If you meet these conditions, you can establish a relationship with an Account Manager who can request the ad credit functionality for you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!",{}
