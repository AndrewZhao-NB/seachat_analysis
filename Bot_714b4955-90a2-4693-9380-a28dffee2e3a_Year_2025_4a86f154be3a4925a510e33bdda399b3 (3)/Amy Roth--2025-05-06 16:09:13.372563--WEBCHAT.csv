bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-06 16:10:17.705461," I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your Shopify pixel integration. To integrate the NewsBreak Pixel into your Shopify store, follow these steps:
1. Log into NewsBreak and navigate to Tools > Ad Manager > Event Management.
2. Choose 'Pixel' as your tracking type, 'Shopify' as the integration method, and specify your event type.
3. Turn on 'Event value' if you have a value associated with this event.
4. Locate your base code in Step 1 and copy that code.
5. Once integrated, test it in Ad Manager or inform your account manager/operations team for verification.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-06 16:11:04.566582," Let's troubleshoot the issue with your Shopify pixel integration. Here are some steps you can follow:
1. **Ensure the Customer Event is Correctly Configured:** Double-check that the customer event is set up correctly in Shopify.
2. **Test the Event:** Perform a test in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly. For a 'complete_payment' event, simulate purchasing a product to verify the setup.
3. **Check Pixel Code Placement:** Make sure the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL and that the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
If you've tried these steps and it's still not working, please contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.
