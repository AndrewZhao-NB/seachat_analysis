bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-10 03:15:10.559781," Great! Here are some steps to troubleshoot your conversion event testing in Everflow:
1. Make sure you're logged into your Everflow account and navigate to the 'Postbacks' section.
2. Check that the Postback URL is correctly set up in NewsBreak's Event Management tab.
3. Ensure that you have selected the correct parameters in your Postback URL, especially if you're using sub2-sub5 instead of sub1.
4. After entering the URL in NewsBreak's Postback testing tool, try triggering a conversion event again and see if you get a green checkmark within 1-2 minutes.
If you're still having issues, you can refer to this article for more detailed instructions: [How to set up an Everflow Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/22576502022285-How-to-set-up-an-Everflow-Postback-on-NewsBreak). Let me know how it goes!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-10 03:16:27.776167," Your Postback URL looks mostly fine, but make sure that you're using the correct parameter for your setup. If you used 'sub1' in your Postback URL, it should match what you've set up in Everflow. Also, ensure that the event type 'add_to_cart' is correctly configured in both platforms. 
If you need to use a different sub parameter (like sub2-sub5), make sure to adjust it accordingly in your landing page URL as well. 
If everything seems correct and you're still having issues, I recommend checking with your Everflow account manager for any specific setup issues on their side. Let me know if you need more help!",{}
