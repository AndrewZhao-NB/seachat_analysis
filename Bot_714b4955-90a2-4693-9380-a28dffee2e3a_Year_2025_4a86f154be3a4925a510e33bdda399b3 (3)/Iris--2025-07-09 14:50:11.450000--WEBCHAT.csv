bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 14:50:49.934653," It looks like you're working with the event management interface for testing pixel integration. To ensure your pixel is set up correctly, follow these steps:

1. Enter your website URL in the ""Test URL"" field.
2. Click the ""Go test"" button to initiate the test.
3. Check if both the base code and conversion event tracking code are firing correctly.
4. Use the ""Reset test"" button if you need to start over, or ""Copy test link"" to share the test link.
5. Once everything is verified, click ""Save"" to finalize your setup.

If you encounter any issues during testing, make sure that your base pixel code is correctly integrated on your landing page and that the conversion event code is placed on the event page where user actions occur.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to our Event Tracking Debugging Steps article.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 14:51:50.285039," If you're having trouble saving your pixel integration test, here are a few things you can check:

1. **Verify the Base Pixel Code:** Ensure that the base pixel code is correctly placed in the `<head>` section of your webpage.

2. **Check Event Code Placement:** Make sure the conversion event tracking code is correctly placed on the event page where user actions occur.

3. **Test URL:** Double-check that the URL entered in the ""Test URL"" field is correct and accessible.

4. **Browser Compatibility:** Sometimes browser settings or extensions can interfere with saving processes. Try using a different browser or disabling extensions temporarily.

5. **Network Issues:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection while performing these actions.

4. **Network Connection:** Make sure you have a stable internet connection while setting up the pixel.

5. **Clear Cache:** Sometimes clearing your browser cache can resolve unexpected issues.
