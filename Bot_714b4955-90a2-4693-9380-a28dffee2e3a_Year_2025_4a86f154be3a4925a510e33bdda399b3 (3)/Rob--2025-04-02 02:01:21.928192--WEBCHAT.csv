bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-02 02:02:57.024036," Thanks for the information, Rob. To troubleshoot your issue with not getting any data from your active ad on NewsBreak Ad Manager, I recommend checking the following steps:
1. Ensure that your tracking setup is correctly configured.
2. Verify that event tracking is properly implemented, as it's essential for optimization and ensuring our backend algorithm performs efficiently.
3. Review the Account Management Guide to ensure everything is set up correctly on your end.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-02 02:03:52.176739," Got it, Rob. Since your previous ads worked fine, let's focus on troubleshooting the current setup. Here are a few steps you can follow to ensure everything is working correctly:
1. **Check Pixel Implementation**: Make sure the pixel code is correctly placed on your landing page and event page.
2. **Simulate the Event**: Perform the action that should trigger the pixel (e.g., simulate a purchase if it's a complete_payment event) to see if it fires correctly.
3. **Verify in Shopify**: If you're using Shopify, ensure that the customer event is correctly configured and test it in both Shopify and NewsBreak.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-02 02:05:14.196746," Thanks for confirming, Rob. If everything is set up correctly and you suspect there might have been changes since your last ad, I recommend checking the latest guidelines and updates on our tracking setup. Here are a few things to verify:
1. **Event Management**: Ensure that your conversion tracking is active by going to 'Tools' and accessing the Event Management tab.
2. **Pixel or Postback**: Confirm that your Pixel or Postback is correctly set up and firing events as expected.
3. **Test Your Setup**: Use the 'Go Test' feature in the Event Management tab to test your event setup.
