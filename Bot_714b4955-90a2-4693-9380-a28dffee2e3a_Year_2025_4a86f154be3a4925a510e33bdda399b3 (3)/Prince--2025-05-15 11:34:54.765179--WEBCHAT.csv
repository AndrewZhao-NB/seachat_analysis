1. **Maximize Conversions Bidding**: Start with the 'Maximize Conversions' bidding strategy. This approach helps gather data quickly and optimizes for conversions, which can help you exit the learning phase faster.

2. **Broad Targeting**: Initially, use broad targeting options to allow the system to gather more data and identify effective audience segments.

3. **Increase Budget Gradually**: Once your campaign starts showing positive results, consider gradually increasing your daily budget by up to 50% every 2-3 days to scale up without disrupting the learning phase.

4. **Test Different Creatives**: Experiment with different ad creatives and messages to see which ones perform best with your target audience.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on performance metrics and make data-driven adjustments as needed, but avoid making too many changes during the initial learning phase.

6. **Patience is Key**: While it's understandable that you want quick results, remember that it typically takes about 20-30 conversions for a campaign to stabilize and exit the learning phase.
