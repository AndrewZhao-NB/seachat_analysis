bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-15 14:37:44.186273," Fake traffic, also known as bot traffic, can occur for various reasons. It might be due to automated scripts or bots that are designed to mimic real user behavior. This can happen if your ads or website are targeted by malicious actors or if there are issues with the ad platform's traffic quality. To address this, you can use tools and services that help detect and filter out fake traffic, and report any suspicious activity to the ad platform you're using.",{}
