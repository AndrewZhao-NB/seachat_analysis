3. **Event Tracking**: Ensure you have event tracking set up for conversion event bidding strategies, as this is crucial for optimization.

4. **Creative Testing**: Continuously test different ad creatives and formats to see what resonates best with your audience.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-28 17:33:24.895432," Let's troubleshoot this issue. Since you're using RedTrack, please ensure that you've set up the postback correctly on NewsBreak. Here's a quick checklist:

1. **Verify Postback URL**: Make sure the postback URL is correctly configured in your RedTrack account.

2. **Event Setup**: In your NewsBreak ad account, go to the 'Create/test web event' section and ensure that you've selected 'Postback' as your tracking type and chosen 'RedTrack' as the 3rd party tracking service.

3. **Test Conversion Flow**: Perform a test conversion to see if it registers on both platforms.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to our guide on setting up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak here: [How to set up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25515090832013-How-to-set-up-a-RedTrack-Postback-on-NewsBreak).
