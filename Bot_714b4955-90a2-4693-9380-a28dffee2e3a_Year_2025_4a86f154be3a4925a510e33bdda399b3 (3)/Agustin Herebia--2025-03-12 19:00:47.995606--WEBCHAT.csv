The issue is that the postbacks are only sent once daily, so we are not able to pass the test to save it (which has a 1 TTL). Can you help?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 19:02:13.908402," Hi Agustin, I understand the issue you're facing with the postbacks being sent only once daily. To help you out, could you please confirm if you have followed all the steps mentioned in our guide for integrating a NewsBreak Postback with Clickflare? Here's a quick summary of the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:
1. Log into your NewsBreak Ad Manager account and head to the Event Management tab.
2. Click 'Create/Test Event' and fill out the required fields, choosing Clickflare as the 3rd party tracking service.
3. Scroll down to the Test URL field, enter the Campaign Tracking URL from Clickflare, and click 'Go test.'
4. Perform the test event on the landing page URL so that Clickflare records a conversion event and fires a postback to NewsBreak.
If you've followed these steps and are still encountering issues due to the daily postback limitation, I recommend reaching out to Clickflare support for further assistance or adjusting your testing schedule accordingly.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to Integrate a NewsBreak Postback with Clickflare](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/28421919800845-How-to-Integrate-a-NewsBreak-Postback-with-Clickflare). Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",{}
