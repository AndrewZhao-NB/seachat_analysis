bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-25 16:33:37.190009," There could be a few reasons why your campaigns aren't spending. One common issue is the launch date at the ad set level. Since Ad Manager is in PST/military time, some advertisers don't realize their campaign is set to start at a later time. You might want to check the launch date and time settings for your campaign.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-25 16:34:13.674186," If the launch date is fine, there might be other factors affecting your campaign spending. Here are a few things you can check:
1. **Budget and Bidding Strategy**: Ensure your budget and bidding strategy are set appropriately for your target audience.
2. **Targeting**: Review your audience targeting to make sure it's not too narrow.
3. **Ad Creative**: Make sure your ad creative is engaging and relevant to your audience.
4. **Ad Scheduling**: Consider scheduling your ads to run during peak hours when your target audience is most active.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-25 16:35:18.800705," I understand your frustration. Here are a few additional steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:
1. **Increase Budget Gradually**: During the learning phase, it's recommended not to make too many changes. Try increasing your budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days.
2. **Ad Set Creation**: Create 2-3 ad sets and once the cold start is complete, keep the higher performing set and switch off the others.
3. **Review Ad Performance**: Regularly review your ad performance in the Reporting tab and make adjustments to improve results.
4. **Experiment with Creatives**: Experiment with different types of assets, such as videos and images, to see which performs best.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-25 16:36:32.952536," Got it. If you're using Max Conversion with no targeting and it's still not spending the daily budget, here are a few things you can try:
1. **Increase Daily Budget**: Sometimes, starting with a higher daily budget can help the system gather data more quickly. Try increasing your daily budget gradually.
2. **Check Learning Phase**: Ensure that your campaign has passed the learning phase. It typically takes about 20-30 conversions to get through this phase.
3. **Review Ad Creative**: Make sure your ad creative is engaging and relevant to your audience.
4. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on performance metrics and make adjustments as needed.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-25 16:37:20.419970," I understand the challenge you're facing. Here are a few additional steps you can take to help your campaign spend its budget and start generating conversions:
1. **Increase Initial Budget**: Start with a higher initial daily budget to give the system more data to work with. This can help it optimize more effectively.
2. **Ad Creative Variations**: Test different ad creatives to see if certain types perform better and attract more engagement.
3. **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor your campaign's performance and make small adjustments as needed.
4. **Relaunch Campaign**: If the current campaign is not performing, consider relaunching it with fresh creatives and a higher initial budget.
