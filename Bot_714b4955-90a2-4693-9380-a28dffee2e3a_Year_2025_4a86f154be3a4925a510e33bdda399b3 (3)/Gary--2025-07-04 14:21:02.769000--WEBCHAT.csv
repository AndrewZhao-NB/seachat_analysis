bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-24 14:21:19.849784," Thanks for sharing the details! Since your campaign is using Max Conversions with a $30/day budget, it might be too low to see significant activity, especially if your CPA is higher. We recommend starting with at least $50/day for better results. Also, during the learning phase (cold start period), it's best not to make changes like text edits as it can disrupt the learning process. 

Consider increasing your daily budget and avoid making changes during this phase. You can refer to our Maximize Conversions Best Practices for more guidance: [Maximize Conversions Best Practices](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23055076590221-Maximize-Conversions-Best-Practices).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-24 14:23:11.043112," I understand your concern about the budget. If your ad was running fine until today, it might be worth checking if there were any changes made to the campaign settings or if there's a temporary issue with the platform. 

You can try slightly increasing your budget in small increments, like $5-$10, to see if that helps without going all the way to $50/day. Also, ensure that no major changes were made recently that could affect performance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-28 14:10:55.548888," I'm sorry to hear that your ads were rejected. There can be various reasons for ad rejection, such as incorrect conversion tracking setup or typographical errors. You should have received an email from Ad Support with the specific reason for the rejection. Please review that email carefully and address the highlighted issues. If you believe your ad complies with our policies, you can appeal the decision by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com. For more detailed guidance, you can check out this article: [My ad got rejected. What's next?](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18085960681101-My-ad-got-rejected-What-s-next). Let me know if there's anything else I can help with!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-28 21:16:31.478436," No, adding a new ad to an active campaign won't stop your existing ads. The new ad will go through the approval process, but your current ads will continue running as usual. If you want to make significant changes, like testing different types of creatives, it's recommended to upload the new ad to a new ad set. This way, your budget won't be impacted while waiting for approval.

So which one is right? Upload to new ad set or upload to current ad set????",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-28 21:25:38.754649," I understand the confusion, and I apologize for any misunderstanding. Here's a clarification:

- **For smaller changes** (like minor tweaks to titles, descriptions, or resizing images), it's recommended to upload the new ad to a **current ad set**. This allows you to test the changes without disrupting your existing setup.

- **For bigger changes** (like experimenting with very different types of creatives), it's better to upload the new ad to a **new ad set**. This helps in isolating the test and analyzing its performance separately.

Both approaches have their place depending on the scale of changes you're making. I hope this clears things up! If you have more questions, feel free to ask.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-03 09:33:12.185108," For optimal performance, static images and GIFs should be in 16x9 (horizontal) format, while video ads perform best in 9x16 (vertical) format. This helps ensure that your ads are engaging and fit well within the platform's layout.",{}
