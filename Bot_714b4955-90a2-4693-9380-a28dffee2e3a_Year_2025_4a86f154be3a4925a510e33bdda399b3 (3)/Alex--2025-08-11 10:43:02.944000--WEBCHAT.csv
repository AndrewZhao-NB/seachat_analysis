I am using https://business.newsbreak.com/business-api/v1/reports/getIntegratedReport

to get data - could you please tell me the exact field name \ property to extract REFID from the ads item? 

Thanks!",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 10:44:34.365136," Hi there! To extract the REFID from the ads item using the NewsBreak API, you would typically look for a field related to 'ref_id' or 'reference_id' in the response data. However, since I don't have access to the exact schema of your API response, I recommend checking the API documentation or reaching out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for precise details on field names. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 10:45:29.843284," In the context of the API you're using, if you're looking to extract a specific identifier like REFID, it might not be directly listed under 'metrics'. The 'metrics' field typically includes performance-related data such as 'COST' and 'IMPRESSION'. For identifiers like REFID, you should look in other parts of the response object, possibly under a section related to ad details or identifiers. If it's not clear from the API documentation, I recommend reaching out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for detailed guidance on which field contains the REFID.",{}
