bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-06 00:33:38.968895," Hi Ryan, I'm sorry to hear about the confusion with your ad rejection. The reason for ad rejection can vary, and it seems like there might have been a misunderstanding. I recommend checking the email you received from Ad Support for specific details on why each ad was rejected. If you believe there was an error, you can appeal the decision by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com. For more information on what to do next after an ad gets rejected, you can refer to this article: [My ad got rejected. What's next?](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18085960681101-My-ad-got-rejected-What-s-next).",{}
