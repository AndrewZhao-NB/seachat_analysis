bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 11:31:49.945838," It sounds like you're trying to test your event tracking setup. Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Verify Base Code Placement**: Ensure that the base pixel code is correctly placed in the `<head>` section of your webpage.

2. **Check Event Code**: Make sure the event code is correctly implemented and fires when the intended action occurs on your page.

3. **Test Pixel or Postback**: Use the 'Go test' feature in NewsBreak Ad Manager to verify if both the base code and conversion code are installed correctly.

4. **Network Issues**: Sometimes, network issues can cause loading problems. Try refreshing the page or testing from a different network.

5. **Browser Compatibility**: Ensure that you are using a compatible browser and clear cache if necessary.

If you've checked these and still face issues, please reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your setup for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-04 12:59:15.649892," Hi there! It sounds like you're encountering an ""Invalid Operation"" error while trying to add a web event. This can happen if there's already an event with the same landing page URL or the same event type and tracking platform under your account. You might want to try using a different landing page URL, a different event type, or create the event under a different account. If you continue to face issues, please reach out to our Ad Support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-04 13:01:21.843674," Yes, you can add multiple web events within one account to test ad performance, build custom audiences, and optimize funnels. Just make sure each event represents a unique action. For example, you can't create two identical events for ""complete_payment"" within Web events, but you can have one for Web and another for App events.
