bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-28 14:12:06.387597," Hi Victoria, there could be several reasons why your pixels aren't being saved on your NewsBreak account. Could you please let me know which platform or service you are using for the pixel? For example, are you using Shopify or Google Tag Manager (GTM)? This will help me provide more specific guidance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-28 14:12:34.046763," Thanks for letting me know, Victoria! If you're using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and having trouble saving your pixel on your NewsBreak account, you can follow these steps to ensure it's set up correctly:
1. **Create a New Tag**: In GTM, create a new tag and select 'Custom HTML' as the tag type.
2. **Add Pixel Code**: Paste your NewsBreak pixel code into the HTML field.
3. **Set Trigger**: Set a trigger for the tag to fire on all pages or specific pages where you want to track events.
4. **Save and Publish**: Save your changes and publish the container.
5. **Verify Integration**: You can test the integration in Ad Manager or inform your account manager/operations team to verify it for you.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to install a NewsBreak Pixel with GTM](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/14333966189581-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-with-GTM). If you continue experiencing issues, please let me know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-28 14:15:09.251069," Got it, Victoria. Since you've already followed the steps to set up the pixel with GTM and it's still not saving, there might be a few other things to check:
1. **Check for Errors**: Make sure there are no errors in your GTM container or in the browser console when you load your website.
2. **Verify Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to make changes in both GTM and NewsBreak Ad Manager.
3. **Test Pixel**: Use the Preview mode in GTM to test if the pixel is firing correctly on your website.
4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes, clearing your browser cache can help resolve issues with changes not being reflected.
5. **Contact Support**: If everything seems correct and it's still not working, it might be best to contact NewsBreak support for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-28 14:15:46.438760," I'm sorry to hear that, Victoria. Let's try to troubleshoot the event setup issue as well. Here are some steps you can follow to set up and test events with GTM:
1. **Create a New Tag**: In GTM, create a new tag and select 'Custom HTML' as the tag type.
2. **Add Event Code**: Paste your NewsBreak event tracking code into the HTML field.
3. **Set Trigger**: Set a trigger for the tag to fire on specific events (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) where you want to track conversions.
4. **Save and Publish**: Save your changes and publish the container.
5. **Test Events**: Use the Preview mode in GTM to test if the event tags are firing correctly on your website.
6. **Verify in Ad Manager**: Log into NewsBreak Ad Manager, go to Tools -> Event Tracking section, input your landing page URL, and click 'Go test'. Trigger your conversion event in the webpage opened by the NewsBreak Event Tracking Tool.
