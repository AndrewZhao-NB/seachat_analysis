Do you have a Business Manager structure or it`s only separate accounts that we have to create apart.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-27 08:35:48.862014," Hi Anna! Welcome to News Break. We do have a structure that allows you to manage multiple ad accounts under one organization. Your organization is usually your company name, and you can create separate ad accounts for different campaigns or products. This way, you don't need to create separate accounts for each campaign. You can manage all your ad accounts under one organization. For more details, you can check out our Account Management Guide here: [Account Management Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17539290349709-Account-Management-Guide). Let me know if you have any other questions!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-02-27 08:46:53.408487," You're welcome, Anna! For the pixel, it's generally recommended to use one pixel per ad account to ensure accurate tracking and optimization for each specific campaign. Using separate pixels for different ad accounts helps in better targeting and performance analysis. If you need more detailed guidance on setting up and managing pixels, feel free to ask!",{}
