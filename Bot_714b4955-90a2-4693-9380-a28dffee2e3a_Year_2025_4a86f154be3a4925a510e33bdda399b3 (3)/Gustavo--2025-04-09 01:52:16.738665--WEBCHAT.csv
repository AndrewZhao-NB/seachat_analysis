bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-11 17:45:09.006261," Let's try to troubleshoot this issue. Please make sure you have followed all the steps in the ClickBank postback setup guide. Here are a few things to check:
1. Ensure that you have updated to Version 8.0, as Version 7.0 is no longer supported.
2. Verify that you have correctly set up the postback URL in ClickBank with the parameter `tid=__CALLBACK_PARAM__`.
3. Test the postback integration by triggering a conversion event and checking if it appears on NewsBreak.
