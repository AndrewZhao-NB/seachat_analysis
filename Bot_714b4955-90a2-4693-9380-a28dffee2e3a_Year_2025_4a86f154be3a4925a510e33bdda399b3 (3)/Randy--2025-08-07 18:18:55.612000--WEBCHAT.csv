bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-07 18:19:17.899479," It sounds like your campaign might be experiencing fluctuations due to the learning phase or changes in bidding strategies. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Learning Phase:** If your campaign is in the learning phase, it's normal to see some fluctuations. This phase typically completes after around 20-30 conversions.

2. **Bidding Strategy:** Review your bidding strategy and consider using Max Conversion bidding during the learning phase to stabilize costs.

3. **Budget Adjustments:** Ensure that you haven't made any significant budget changes recently, as this can impact performance.

4. **Targeting Settings:** Double-check your targeting settings to ensure they align with your campaign goals.

For more detailed guidance, you can refer to our article on [Maximize Conversions Best Practices](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23055076590221-Maximize-Conversions-Best-Practices).

web,WEBCHAT,1a0b3eae0c1448ea8f9ef8939bd7d6ee,Randy ,2025-08-07 18:25:44.246888,None of that is the problem. The first 6 days my average CPC's were $0.25 and the last 2 days they've balloned up to an average of $ $0.77 because of the super high CPM's. I've never had a CPM on Taboola or Outbrain with CPC's anywhere near that amount and there's a much lower clickthru rate on those platfomrs.,{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-07 18:26:19.168620," It seems like there might be a sudden change in the competitive landscape or audience targeting that's affecting your CPM and CPC rates. Here are a few things you can consider:

1. **Competitive Bidding:** Check if there's increased competition for your targeted audience, which could drive up CPM rates.

2. **Audience Targeting:** Review your audience targeting settings to ensure they haven't changed unexpectedly.

3. **Ad Creative Performance:** Evaluate the performance of your ad creatives; sometimes changes in engagement can impact costs.

4. **Platform Differences:** Keep in mind that Newsbreak's algorithm and audience may differ from Taboola or Outbrain, which can affect performance metrics.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-07 18:28:46.989492," When you leave targeting open, the algorithm does its best to optimize based on available data, but fluctuations can still occur. Unfortunately, Newsbreak doesn't offer a direct way to set a maximum CPC or CPM limit. However, you can try adjusting your bidding strategy:

1. **Bidding Strategy:** Consider switching to tCPA bidding if you're looking to control costs more effectively.

2. **Budget Management:** Monitor your daily budget closely and adjust it incrementally if needed.

3. **Performance Monitoring:** Keep an eye on performance metrics and make adjustments as necessary.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-07 18:29:29.912337," To check competition and manage competitive bidding, you can follow these steps:

1. **Analyze Performance Reports:** Use the reporting tools to analyze your campaign's performance metrics like CPM, CPC, and CTR. This can give you insights into how competitive your ad space is.

2. **Monitor Industry Trends:** Keep an eye on industry trends and seasonal changes that might affect competition levels.

3. **Adjust Bidding Strategy:** If you notice high competition, consider adjusting your bidding strategy to Target CPA (tCPA) for more control over costs.

4. **Experiment with Ad Creatives:** Test different ad creatives to see which ones perform better in a competitive environment.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-07 18:34:40.216122," I understand how frustrating it can be to see such drastic changes in CPM. Here are a few additional steps you might consider:

1. **Real-Time Monitoring:** While minute-by-minute monitoring isn't feasible, setting up alerts for significant changes in your metrics can help you respond quickly.

2. **Daily Budget Caps:** Implement daily budget caps to prevent overspending due to unexpected CPM spikes.

3. **Ad Scheduling:** Consider scheduling your ads during specific times when competition might be lower, potentially stabilizing CPM rates.

4. **Consult Support:** If the issue persists, it might be beneficial to reach out directly to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for a deeper analysis of your account and campaigns.
