Any way to download this table or just download monthly bill by account?
We need it for internal reporting",{}

However, you can review each payment you've made in 'transaction history' and track daily ad costs in the accompanying tab. If you need further assistance with reporting, feel free to reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
