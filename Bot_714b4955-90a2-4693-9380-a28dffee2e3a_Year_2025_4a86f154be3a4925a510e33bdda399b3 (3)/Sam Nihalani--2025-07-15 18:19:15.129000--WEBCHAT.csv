bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-15 18:20:02.407359," Let's figure out why your campaign isn't spending. Could you provide me with some details about your campaign, such as the start date, bidding type, targeting or budget settings, and any recent changes made in the last 72 hours? This information will help me assist you better.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-15 18:21:08.967007," Thanks for the details! Since your campaign started yesterday and is using the Maximize Conversions strategy, it might still be in the learning phase. This phase typically completes after around 20-30 conversions. During this time, minimal changes should be made to allow the system to analyze performance signals and optimize audience segments and placements. 

If you haven't seen any conversions yet, it might take a bit more time for your campaign to stabilize. I recommend monitoring it closely over the next few days.

For more information on maximizing conversions, you can check out this article: [Maximize Conversions Best Practices](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23055076590221-Maximize-Conversions-Best-Practices).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-15 18:29:51.585807," I apologize for any frustration. Let's take a closer look at your campaign settings to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Targeting Settings**: Make sure your targeting isn't too narrow, as this can limit the audience reach.
2. **Ad Schedule**: Verify that your ads are scheduled to run during times when your target audience is active.
3. **Creative Quality**: Ensure that your ad content is engaging and relevant to your audience.
4. **Budget Settings**: Double-check that the budget is correctly set and not restricted by other settings.

If everything seems correct and you're still facing issues, it might be worth reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
