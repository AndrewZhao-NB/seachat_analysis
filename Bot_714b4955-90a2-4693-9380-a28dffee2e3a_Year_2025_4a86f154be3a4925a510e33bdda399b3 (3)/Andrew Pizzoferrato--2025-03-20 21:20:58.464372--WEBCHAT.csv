1. Double-check that the time zone settings in your ad account match your local time zone.
2. Ensure that you've saved the changes after selecting the specific times.
3. Verify that there are no conflicting settings in other parts of your ad campaign that might override the scheduling.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-20 21:26:34.373884," Conflicting settings that might cause issues with your ad scheduling could include:
1. **Campaign-Level Settings:** Ensure that the overall campaign settings do not have a different schedule that overrides the ad set level schedule.
2. **Budget and Delivery Settings:** Check if there are any budget constraints or delivery optimizations that might affect when your ads are shown.
3. **Ad Set Priorities:** If you have multiple ad sets, make sure their schedules do not conflict with each other, as this can sometimes cause unexpected behavior.
4. **Time Zone Mismatch:** Verify that all time-related settings are using the same time zone to avoid discrepancies in scheduling.
If you've checked these and still face issues, it might be best to contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for more detailed troubleshooting.",{}
