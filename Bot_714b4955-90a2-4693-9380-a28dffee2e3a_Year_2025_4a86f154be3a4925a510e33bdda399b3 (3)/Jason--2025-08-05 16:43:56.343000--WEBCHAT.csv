bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-05 16:45:02.687262," Hi there! Let's try to figure out why your ads aren't running as expected. Could you please check the following details for me?

1. **Campaign Start Date:** Make sure the campaign is set to run today and hasn't ended.
2. **Bidding Type:** Confirm if you're using Max Conversion or tCPA bidding, as this can affect ad delivery.
3. **Targeting or Budget Settings:** Double-check if there have been any changes in targeting or budget settings that might impact ad delivery.
4. **Recent Changes:** Have there been any changes made in the last 72 hours that could affect performance?

Once you have this information, we can look into it further. Also, remember that during the learning phase, fluctuations are normal, and it might take some time for performance to stabilize.",{}
