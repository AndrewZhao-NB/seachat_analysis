bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-02 20:35:28.579112," Let's figure out why your ads aren't spending or getting impressions. Could you provide more details on the following?

- Campaign start date
- Bidding type (CPC or CPM)
- Targeting or budget settings
- Any recent changes in the last 72 hours

Once I have this information, I can help you troubleshoot further!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-02 20:36:56.415757," Thanks for the details! Since your campaign started on June 1st and is using CPC bidding with a $50/day budget, here are a few things to consider:

1. **Learning Phase**: Your ads might still be in the learning phase, which typically takes about 20-30 conversions to complete. During this time, minimal changes should be made to avoid disrupting the process.

2. **Bidding Strategy**: Consider switching to Max Conversion bidding if you haven't already. This can help speed up the learning phase by optimizing for conversions.

3. **Targeting and Audience**: Double-check your targeting settings to ensure they are not too narrow, which could limit impressions.

4. **Ad Quality and Relevance**: Ensure that your ad creatives are engaging and relevant to your target audience.

If these suggestions don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to review your campaign settings in detail or reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
