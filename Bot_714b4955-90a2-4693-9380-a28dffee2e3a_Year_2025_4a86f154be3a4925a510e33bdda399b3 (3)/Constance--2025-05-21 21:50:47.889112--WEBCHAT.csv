bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-21 21:52:29.547965," Hi there! Ad credits are typically applied to the account as a whole, so they should be available for any campaign you run under that account. However, if you're seeing it only for one campaign, it might be due to specific settings or conditions related to the campaigns. I recommend checking your campaign settings and ensuring both are set up correctly. If the issue persists, please reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
