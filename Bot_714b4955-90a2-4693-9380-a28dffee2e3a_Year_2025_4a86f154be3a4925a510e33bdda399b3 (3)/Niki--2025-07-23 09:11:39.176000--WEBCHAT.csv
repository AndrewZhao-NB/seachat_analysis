I understand that if mmp is used for integration, the DSP should use the data returned by mmp for event display. I would like to confirm the logic of event display: Is it based on the time when the event was received by newsbreak or the time when the advertisement was recalled for data display?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 09:14:46.888301," Hi there! The logic of event display on the dashboard panel is typically based on the time when the event was received by NewsBreak. This means that the data shown reflects when NewsBreak actually received the event information from your MMP integration. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 09:17:32.579391," Yes, that's correct! If a user who installed the app a while ago triggers an event today, it will be classified as today's event data. The event is recorded based on when it was received by NewsBreak, not when the app was initially installed. Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 09:20:32.606078," There isn't a fixed installation window period for event display. It's possible for an advertisement that has been shut down to still receive new event data if users who installed the app during the ad's active period continue to engage with it. These events will be recorded as they occur, regardless of the ad's current status. If you have more questions, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 09:20:55.405158," NewsBreak does process the events received from MMPs, which can include filtering and deduplication to ensure data accuracy and reliability.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 09:32:46.228767," I'm sorry, but I don't have the specific details on the exact processing methods NewsBreak uses for handling events from MMPs, such as filtering and deduplication. For detailed information, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com. They'll be able to provide more precise insights into the processes involved.",{}
