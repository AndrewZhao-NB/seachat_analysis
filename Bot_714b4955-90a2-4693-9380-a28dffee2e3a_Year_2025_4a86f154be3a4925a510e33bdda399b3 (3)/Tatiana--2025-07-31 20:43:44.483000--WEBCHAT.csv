bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-31 20:44:49.885086," If your ad was rejected, you have a couple of options. You can either modify the existing ad or create a new one, depending on the specific issues that caused the rejection. If the issues can be fixed with minor adjustments, like resizing an image or correcting text errors, modifying the existing ad might be more efficient. However, if the rejection was due to fundamental issues, such as content that doesn't comply with policies, creating a new ad that adheres to our guidelines from the start could be a better approach.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-31 23:17:04.985487," Thanks for letting me know you're using Google Tag Manager (GTM). The 'Invalid Operation' error might occur if there's already an event with the same landing page URL or event type saved under your account. Here are a few steps you can try:

1. Check if there's an existing event with the same landing page URL and event type. If so, you might need to use a different URL or event type.
2. Try creating the pixel under a different account if possible.
3. Use the Event Tracking Tool to test and verify while still using existing saved events.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-01 13:55:13.939020," If your ad was rejected, you can fix the issues by addressing the specific reason for rejection.

1. Go to your campaign dashboard.
