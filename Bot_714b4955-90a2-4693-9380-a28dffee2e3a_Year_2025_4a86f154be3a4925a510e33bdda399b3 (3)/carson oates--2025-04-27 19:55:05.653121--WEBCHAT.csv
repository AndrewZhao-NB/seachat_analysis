bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-27 19:55:48.525737, I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble cloning an ad. Could you please let me know if you're receiving any specific error messages or if the process just doesn't complete? This will help me assist you better.,{}
web,WEBCHAT,d9ca95dc27684badba3bfc180f7b6da8,carson oates ,2025-04-27 19:56:16.908168,no error it publishing when i submit but nothing shows inside my ad set or ads that i just created,{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-27 19:56:27.215434," It sounds like there might be an issue with the ad creation process. Here are a few things you can check:
1. Make sure to hit 'Save and Next' instead of just 'Save' at the Campaign and Ad set level, unless you're creating a draft.
2. Verify that you have a valid payment method associated with your account, even if you're using ad credits.
3. Ensure that the landing page URL is correctly formatted without capitalizing the ""h"" in ""http://"" or ""https://"".
If you've checked these and are still experiencing issues, I recommend reaching out to our support team for further assistance by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-27 19:56:42.050634," Thanks for the additional information. Since this is an older ad set with running ads, you might want to try the following:
1. Keep the old ads live and turn off the new ads if they aren't showing up. This way, your budget won't be impacted.
2. If you're implementing bigger changes or experimenting with different types of creatives, consider uploading the new ad to a new ad set.
3. Monitor the performance of any new creatives over a 7-day period to assess their impact.
If these steps don't resolve your issue, please contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
