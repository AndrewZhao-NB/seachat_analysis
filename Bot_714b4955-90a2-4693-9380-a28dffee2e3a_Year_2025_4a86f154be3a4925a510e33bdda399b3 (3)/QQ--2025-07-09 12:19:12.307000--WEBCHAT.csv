bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 12:22:14.534495," Thanks for letting me know you're using Shopify. To troubleshoot your pixel issue, please ensure the following:

1. Verify that the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify.
2. Check if the pixel code is placed correctly in the theme.liquid file of your Shopify store.
3. Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
4. For a purchase event like `complete_payment`, simulate a product purchase to verify the setup.

1. **Placement**: Make sure the pixel code is placed right before the closing `</head>` tag. It looks like it's in the right location based on your screenshot.

2. **ID Verification**: Check that the ID (`ID-1942173221448863745`) is correct and reflects your NewsBreak account. If it’s not, update it.

3. **Event Tracking**: Ensure you're triggering events correctly. For example, you should see an `nbpix('event', 'pageLoad');` to track page loads. If you're also tracking purchases or other events, confirm those events are triggered correctly in the code.

4. **Console Errors**: Open your browser's developer tools (usually F12) and check the console for any JavaScript errors that might be preventing the pixel from firing.

5. **Testing**: Use a test purchase or page load to see if the pixel is firing correctly. You can validate the pixel event using a pixel helper tool or by checking the dashboard in your NewsBreak account.

If everything appears correct but you still don’t see any data, you may want to contact NewsBreak support for further assistance. They can offer more insights based on your specific configuration and integration.",
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 12:24:48.020286," It sounds like you've already taken some great steps to troubleshoot your pixel integration on Shopify. Here are a few additional things you might consider:

1. **Double-Check Placement**: Ensure the pixel code is indeed right before the closing `</head>` tag in your `theme.liquid` file.

2. **Verify ID**: Make sure the ID (`ID-1942173221448863745`) matches your NewsBreak account's unique ID.

3. **Event Tracking**: Confirm that all events, such as `nbpix('event', 'pageLoad');`, are correctly set up and firing as expected.

4. **Console Errors**: Use your browser's developer tools to check for any JavaScript errors that might be affecting the pixel.

5. **Testing Tools**: Utilize a pixel helper tool or check your NewsBreak dashboard to ensure events are being tracked properly.

Thanks for sharing your code snippet. It looks like you have the NewsBreak pixel set up to capture multiple events. Here are some suggestions to troubleshoot further:

1. **URL Check**: Verify that the URL for the pixel (`https://static.newsbreak.com/business/tracking/nbpixel.js`) is correct and accessible. You can try entering it in your browser to see if it loads.

2. **Event Subscription**: Confirm each event is firing by checking the relevant triggers in your Shopify dashboard and the console for any related errors or logs.

3. **Data Layer Confirmation**: Ensure data like `event.data.checkout.totalPrice.amount` is properly defined before the corresponding event functions are triggered. You can add console logs to confirm values.

4. **Debugging in Console**: Use the browser’s console to manually call the pixel events and see if they send data correctly. For example, you could try:
   ```javascript
   nbpix('event', 'complete_payment', { nb_value: 100 });
   ```
   Replace `100` with an appropriate amount for testing.

5. **Cross-Origin Issues**: Make sure there aren’t any cross-origin issues preventing the script from running.

If you still face challenges, reaching out to NewsBreak support may provide insights specific to their tracking mechanism.",
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 12:27:23.149884," It seems like you've been thorough in your troubleshooting process. Here are a few more advanced steps you can try:

1. **URL Accessibility**: Double-check that the pixel URL (`https://static.newsbreak.com/business/tracking/nbpixel.js`) is accessible by entering it directly into your browser.

2. **Event Subscription**: Ensure that each event is correctly firing by checking the triggers in your Shopify dashboard and looking for any errors or logs in the console.

3. **Data Layer Verification**: Make sure that data such as `event.data.checkout.totalPrice.amount` is defined before triggering the event functions. Adding console logs can help verify these values.

4. **Console Debugging**: Use the browser's console to manually trigger pixel events and check if they send data correctly, like this:
   ```javascript
   nbpix('event', 'complete_payment', { nb_value: 100 });
   ```
   Adjust `100` to a suitable test amount.

5. **Cross-Origin Issues**: Verify there are no cross-origin issues blocking the script from executing.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 12:42:29.972680," Yes, that's correct. If you've set up the pixel to track the payment completion event, it will only trigger and capture data when a payment is successfully completed. To test this setup, you would need to simulate a purchase on your Shopify store to ensure that the event fires correctly. Make sure that all necessary conditions for the event are met during your test.",{}

So now I just need to purchase an order myself and let the pixel build successfully right?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 12:45:42.692265," Exactly! Since you've added extra events like 'add to cart' and 'add payment info', those will trigger separately. For the payment completion event, you'll need to complete a purchase yourself to test if the pixel fires correctly for that specific event. Once you make a purchase, you should see the pixel capturing the payment completion data successfully.",{}
