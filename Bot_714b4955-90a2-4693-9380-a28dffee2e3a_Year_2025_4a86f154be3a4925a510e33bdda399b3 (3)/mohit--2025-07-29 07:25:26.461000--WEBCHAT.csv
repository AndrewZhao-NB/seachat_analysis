bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-29 07:26:48.048765," Unfortunately, you can't delete web events directly from the NewsBreak platform. If a web event is no longer needed, you can rename it with a prefix like 'DO NOT USE' to avoid confusion. This helps ensure that the event doesn't impact any ongoing campaigns.

seachat_sys,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-29 07:30:12.793642,"It looks like you're encountering an ""Invalid operation"" error when trying to set up your pixel. Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. **Check Event Code**: Ensure that you’re using the exact code provided without any modifications. It should look like this:
   ```html
   <script>
     nbpix('event', 'contact');
   </script>
   ```

2. **Single Event**: Make sure you are only trying to track one event at a time. You may want to confirm that there isn't another event already set up that might be conflicting.

3. **Test URL**: Ensure the landing page URL you’re testing is correct and that it doesn’t redirect elsewhere. The URL you input should link directly to a page where the pixel code has been implemented.

4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes browser cache can interfere. Clear your cache and try again.

5. **Contact Support**: If the problem persists after trying the above, it may be best to reach out to your account manager or support team for further assistance.

If you have any further details or other questions, feel free to ask!",
