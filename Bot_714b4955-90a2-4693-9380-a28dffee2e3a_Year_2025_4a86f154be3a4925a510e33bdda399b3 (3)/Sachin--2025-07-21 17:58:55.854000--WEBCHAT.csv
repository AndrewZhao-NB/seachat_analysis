bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 18:24:01.194134," Thanks for providing the start date. Could you also let me know the bidding type, targeting or budget settings, and if there have been any recent changes in the last 72 hours? This information will help us further diagnose why your campaign isn't receiving clicks.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 18:24:11.513205," Thanks for providing the details! Since your campaign started on 7/18/2025 and you're using CPC bidding, let's check a few things:

1. **Learning Phase**: Your campaign might still be in the learning phase, which typically completes after around 20-30 conversions. During this time, minimal changes should be made.

2. **Targeting and Budget**: Ensure your targeting settings are broad enough to reach a larger audience and that your budget is sufficient to generate clicks.

3. **Ad Creative**: Review your ad creative to ensure it's engaging and relevant to your target audience.

If everything seems fine, I recommend monitoring the campaign for a few more days as it stabilizes. If you continue to experience issues, please let me know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 18:24:35.569986," With a targeting setting focused on the US and a budget of $100, your campaign should be able to reach a decent audience. Here are some suggestions:

1. **Broad Targeting**: Ensure your targeting isn't too narrow. Broad targeting is generally recommended for conversion-based campaigns.

2. **Budget Adjustments**: If your campaign is still in the learning phase, consider gradually increasing your budget by 30-50% every few days to help it stabilize.

3. **Ad Creative**: Double-check that your ad creative is compelling and relevant to attract clicks.

If these adjustments don't help, it might be worth reviewing the campaign settings or trying different ad creatives. Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}
