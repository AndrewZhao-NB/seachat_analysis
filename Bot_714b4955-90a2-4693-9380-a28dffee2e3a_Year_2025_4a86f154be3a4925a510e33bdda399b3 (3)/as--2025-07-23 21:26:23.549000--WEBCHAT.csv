bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-05 16:42:15.643353," It looks like you're interested in setting up a NewsBreak Pixel with Google Tag Manager (GTM). To do this, you'll need to install the NewsBreak Pixel base code on GTM. Here's a quick overview of the steps:

1. Log in to your Google Tag Manager account and select the appropriate Workspace for your website.
2. Click on 'Tags' in the left-hand sidebar and then click the 'New' button.
3. Give this tag a meaningful name (e.g., NewsBreak Pixel Base Code), then click on the 'Tag Configuration' box.
4. Choose 'Custom HTML' and input your scripts.
5. In a separate tab, log in to NewsBreak Ad Manager, go to Tools -> Event Tracking, create an event with Pixel, and choose to integrate with GTM.
6. Copy the NewsBreak Pixel conversion code from your NewsBreak Ad Manager Event Tracking Tool and paste it into GTM.
7. Create or select an existing trigger for your conversion pixel.
8. Save your changes and test if the pixel is installed correctly using GTM's Preview mode or the NewsBreak Ad Manager Event Tracking Tool.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to our help article here: [How to install a NewsBreak Pixel with GTM](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/14333966189581-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-with-GTM).",{}
