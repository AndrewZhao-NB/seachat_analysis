It looks like you're encountering an ""Invalid operation"" error while trying to save a pixel web event. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check Your Code**: Ensure that the script code you input is correct and follows the required syntax. Any typos or formatting issues can lead to errors.

2. **Validate Funnel URL**: Double-check that the funnel URL you are using is valid and correctly formatted. Make sure it doesn’t contain any leading or trailing spaces.

3. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to create or modify the event. Sometimes account or user permissions can restrict operations.

4. **Clear Cache**: Try clearing your browser cache or using a different browser to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Consult Documentation**: Look at any official documentation or troubleshooting guides related to the platform you are using. There might be specific requirements or common issues related to the error you're encountering.

6. **Contact Support**: If the error persists after trying the above steps, it might be best to reach out to your Account Manager or the support team for additional assistance.

If you need help with specific code or further troubleshooting tips, feel free to share more details!",
