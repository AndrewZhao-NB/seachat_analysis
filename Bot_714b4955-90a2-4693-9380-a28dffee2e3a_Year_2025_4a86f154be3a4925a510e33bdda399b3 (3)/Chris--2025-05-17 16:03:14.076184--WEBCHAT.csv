bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-17 16:07:31.003458," No worries! If you're using Shopify, let's focus on ensuring your NewsBreak Pixel is correctly set up. Here's what you can do:
1. Verify that the base pixel code is placed correctly in the `<head>` section of your `theme.liquid` file in Shopify.
2. Ensure that the custom event code is added to the specific pages where you want to track conversions.
3. Test the event by simulating a purchase or action that should trigger the pixel.
If you've done these steps and it's still not verifying, you might want to check if the pixel fires correctly using Shopify's 'Test' feature or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.
