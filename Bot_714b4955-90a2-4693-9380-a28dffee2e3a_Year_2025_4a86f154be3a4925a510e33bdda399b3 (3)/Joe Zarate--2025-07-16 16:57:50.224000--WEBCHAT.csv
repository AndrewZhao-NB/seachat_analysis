I already tested the pixel and it signaled that it was tracking properly. Does it usually just take some time for the conversion to show in platform?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-16 16:58:58.780546," Hey there! It sounds like you've done a great job testing your pixel. Typically, conversions should appear in Ads Manager relatively quickly, but there can be a slight delay depending on the reporting method used. If you're using the 'Ad Management' tab, it should be real-time. However, if you're checking through custom reports under the 'Reports' tab or via API, there might be a 2-3 hour delay. If the conversion still doesn't show up after this time frame, you might want to double-check your setup or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-16 16:59:18.051215," Since it's been 10 hours, the conversion should have appeared in Ads Manager by now. If it's still not showing, there might be an issue with the setup or tracking. I recommend checking your event management settings to ensure everything is configured correctly. If everything seems fine and the issue persists, please reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for more detailed assistance.",{}
