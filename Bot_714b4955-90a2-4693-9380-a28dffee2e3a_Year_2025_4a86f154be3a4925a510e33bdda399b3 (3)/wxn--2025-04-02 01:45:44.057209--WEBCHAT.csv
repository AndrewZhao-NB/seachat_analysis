bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-02 02:00:02.500947," Thanks for the information. Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot why your campaign isn't spending:
1. **Launch Date**: Ensure that the launch date at the ad set level is correct. Sometimes, campaigns are set to start at a later time due to Ad Manager being in PST/military time.
2. **Budget Adjustments**: During the learning phase, avoid making too many changes as it can cause fluctuations in performance. It's recommended to increase your budget no more than 50% every 2-3 days.
3. **Bid Rate**: Make sure your bid rate is competitive enough using our bid estimation tool.
