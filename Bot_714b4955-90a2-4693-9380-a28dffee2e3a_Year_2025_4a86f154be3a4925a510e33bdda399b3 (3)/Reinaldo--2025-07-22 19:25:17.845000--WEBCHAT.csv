bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 19:26:45.031619," Hi there! On our platform, the ""conversion"" column for CPM (Cost Per Mille) and CPC (Cost Per Click) campaigns will always display “0” because these campaigns do not optimize for conversions. However, if you have implemented Pixel/Postback for any event from the pre-defined list of events, the event count will be reported in Ad Management in the corresponding event column. We support reporting for the “conversion_event” and “sale” events in multi-event reporting. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

For more detailed information, you can check out our [Reporting Conversions for CPC and CPM Campaigns](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27582069096461-Reporting-Conversions-for-CPC-and-CPM-Campaigns) article.",{}
