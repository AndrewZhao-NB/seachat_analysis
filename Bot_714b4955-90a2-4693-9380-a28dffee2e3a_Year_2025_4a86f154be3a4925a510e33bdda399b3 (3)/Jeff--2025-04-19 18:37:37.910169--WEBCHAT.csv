bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-20 15:53:42.660377," Thanks for letting me know, Jeff. Let's try to troubleshoot this further. Here are some steps you can follow to debug the pixel issue on Shopify:
1. Ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page (where the user action takes place).
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel (e.g., simulate purchasing a product if it's a complete_payment event).
4. Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
If you've tried these steps and the pixel still doesn't fire, please contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-25 23:56:12.800774," To effectively draw someone to your landing page, you can use a variety of creative strategies. Here are some high-performing funnels:
1. **Native image → prelander page → product page**: This engages users with eye-catching image ads, leading to a prelander that builds interest before ultimately driving them to the product page.
2. **Native image → advertorial → product page**: Uses a content-driven approach, where an advertorial educates and convinces users before directing them to the product page.
3. **Local interest {city/state} → product review/recommendation**: Leverages dynamic copywriting to make ads more locally relevant, leading to a review or recommendation that drives conversions.
4. **Educational video → VSL**: Uses informative content to engage users, leading to a longer-form VSL that pitches the product.
5. **UGC (User-Generated Content) → VSL/Product page**: Builds trust with authentic user content in the ad creative before driving users to a VSL or directly to the product page for conversion.
These strategies are designed to guide users from awareness to conversion effectively.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-26 01:30:12.958992," For video ads on NewsBreak, the best performing size is generally 9x16 (vertical format). This format tends to engage users effectively.
