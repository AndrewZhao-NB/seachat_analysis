bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-01 06:45:45.193441," Sure! Here's a brief overview of how these bidding strategies work:
1. **Max Conversion Value Bidding**: This strategy automatically optimizes and tailors bids for your ads to get the highest conversion value within your specified daily budget. It aims to maximize the total value of conversions rather than just the number of conversions.
2. **Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**: This strategy allows you to set a target return on ad spend, and our Ad Manager will adjust your bids to achieve that target. It focuses on delivering conversions that meet your specific ROAS goal.
Both strategies utilize AI and machine learning to optimize performance and require the integration of a pixel/postback for tracking conversions.
