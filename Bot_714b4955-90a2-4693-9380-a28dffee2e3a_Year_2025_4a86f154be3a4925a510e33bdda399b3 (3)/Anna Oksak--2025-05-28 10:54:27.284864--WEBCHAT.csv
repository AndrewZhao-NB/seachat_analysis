bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 11:18:39.858963," To increase your ad volume, consider the following strategies:

1. **Budget Increase**: Gradually increase your budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days to avoid fluctuations in performance.

2. **Targeting**: Start with broad targeting to help identify the users most likely to convert on your offers. You can refine it later based on performance data.

3. **Bidding Strategy**: Use Max Conversion bidding during the learning phase to speed up the process and then switch to tCPA bidding if needed.

4. **Ad Creativity**: Invest in visually compelling ad content that resonates with your audience.

5. **Monitoring and Optimization**: Regularly review your ad performance and make adjustments as needed.

6. **Testing**: Run A/B tests to identify which ad variations perform best before allocating more budget.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 11:48:32.702969," Great to hear that you've implemented the recommendations! Since your campaigns were created yesterday, they might still be in the learning phase. It typically takes about 20 to 30 conversions for the system to optimize effectively.

Here are a few things you can do:

1. **Monitor Performance**: Keep an eye on your campaign's performance daily to see how it's progressing.

2. **Patience During Learning Phase**: Allow some time for the system to gather data and optimize. Avoid making frequent changes during this period.

3. **Check Settings**: Ensure your targeting and budget settings align with your goals.
