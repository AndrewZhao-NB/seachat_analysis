bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-28 16:23:16.269315," Hi there! It sounds like you're almost set up. After attaching your credit card, you should ensure that it's saved as your primary payment method. You can do this by accessing the Billing Section and checking if your card is listed as the primary method. If you haven't already, you might also want to add ad credits if you're using the Prepay option. If you're still facing issues, please let me know more details so I can assist further!",{}
