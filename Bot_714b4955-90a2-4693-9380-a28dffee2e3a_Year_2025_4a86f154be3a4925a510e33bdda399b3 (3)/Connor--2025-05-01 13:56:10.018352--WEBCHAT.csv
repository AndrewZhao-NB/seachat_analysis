bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-01 13:57:22.711409," It looks like you can't delete events once they're created, but you can rename them to something like ""voided"" or ""no longer used"" to distinguish them. Then, you can create a new event with the correct setup. The algorithm will only consider events applied to live Ad Sets, so renaming should help avoid confusion.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-01 13:58:46.079235," Unfortunately, you can't change the category of your account directly. If you need to manage different types of campaigns or products, you might consider creating separate ad accounts for each category. This way, you can effectively manage your campaigns under different categories.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-01 13:59:47.789388," You don't necessarily need to do a test purchase on every account. Test purchases are typically used to ensure that your tracking and event setup is working correctly. If you've confirmed that your tracking is set up properly on one account, you can replicate the setup across other accounts without needing to perform a test purchase each time. However, if you're using different tracking methods or platforms for each account, it might be beneficial to do a test purchase to verify everything is functioning as expected.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-01 14:00:51.306553," To replicate the setup across other accounts without performing a test purchase each time, you can follow these steps:
1. **Document Your Setup:** Make sure to document the exact steps and settings you used for your initial successful setup.
2. **Use the Same Pixel or Postback:** If you're using Pixels or Postbacks, you can use the same ones across multiple ads within the same advertising account. This makes it easier to replicate tracking setups.
3. **Copy Settings:** When creating new events or ad sets in other accounts, manually input the same settings and configurations as your documented successful setup.
4. **Verify Settings:** Double-check that all settings match your original setup, including event names, tracking types, and any specific parameters.
5. **Test Once:** If possible, perform a single test on one of the new accounts to ensure everything is working as expected before applying it to all others.
