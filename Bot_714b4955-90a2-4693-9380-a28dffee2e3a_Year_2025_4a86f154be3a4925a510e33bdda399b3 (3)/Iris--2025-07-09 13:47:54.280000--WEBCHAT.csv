It seems like you’re experiencing a problem with the pixel setup, where the ""Save"" button isn't being activated. Here are a few steps you can try to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check Test URL**: Ensure that the Test URL you entered is valid and correctly formatted. There may be restrictions on which URLs can be used, so double-check that it meets the necessary criteria.

2. **Complete the Testing**: Make sure all steps in the testing process have been completed. Sometimes, the ""Save"" option won’t activate until the event testing is fully finished, or if there are errors that need addressing.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Try using a different web browser or clearing the cache of your current browser. This can resolve issues caused by cached data.

4. **Pop-up Blockers**: Ensure that any pop-up blockers or ad blockers are disabled. These can interfere with the testing process.

5. **Order Status**: While the store itself does not necessarily have to be out of order, if you’re testing specific events (like a checkout), any transaction-related functions should be operational to trigger all necessary events.

6. **Refresh & Retry**: Sometimes, simply refreshing the page and re-entering the necessary details can resolve the issue.

If you continue to face problems, consider reaching out to support for the pixel integration tool you are using.",
