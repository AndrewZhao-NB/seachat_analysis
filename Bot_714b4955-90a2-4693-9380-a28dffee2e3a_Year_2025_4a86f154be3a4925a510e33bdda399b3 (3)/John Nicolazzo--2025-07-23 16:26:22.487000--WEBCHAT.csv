bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-23 16:31:40.393056," Thanks for providing the details about your ad rejection. It seems like the issue might be related to the URL's accessibility outside of the United States.

If you believe this was a misunderstanding, you can submit an appeal by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com with details explaining the situation. Make sure to mention that your URL works when accessed from within the US.
