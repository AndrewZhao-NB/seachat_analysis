I used Everflow's testing tool to verify the postback. Everflow says it works. But, Newsbreak's testing tool never finishes verification. I can't go all the way through the funnel by clicking because it is a paid product",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 16:50:34.242606," Hi there! It sounds like you're having some trouble with testing your conversion postbacks on NewsBreak using Everflow. Let's try to troubleshoot this together.

First, ensure that you have correctly set up the Postback URL in your Everflow account. You can follow these steps:

1. Log in to your Everflow account and click on the upper left menu button, then select ""Postbacks.""
2. Select the following items:
   - Status: Active
   - Postback Type: Conversion
   - Postback Level: Global
   - Delivery Method: Postback
3. Enter the Postback URL generated from NewsBreak's ad platform under Tools → Event management → Web Events → Create/test web event.
4. Name the event, select Postback, choose Everflow as the tracking service, and choose your event type.
5. Save and proceed with testing in our Ad Manager.
6. Make sure to append “=__CALLBACK_PARAM__” to your offer's landing page URL for testing purposes.
7. Use NewsBreak's Postback testing tool at the bottom of the page to trigger a conversion event.
8. If you see a green checkmark within 1-2 minutes, it means the postback is successful.
9. If unsuccessful, switch tabs back to Everflow and manually trigger a conversion event to see if a postback is generated there.
10. If no postback is generated in Everflow, please work with your Everflow AM for further assistance as it might be a setup issue on their side.
11. If a postback is generated but not recorded by NewsBreak, take a screenshot and send it to your NewsBreak POC or contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further investigation.
