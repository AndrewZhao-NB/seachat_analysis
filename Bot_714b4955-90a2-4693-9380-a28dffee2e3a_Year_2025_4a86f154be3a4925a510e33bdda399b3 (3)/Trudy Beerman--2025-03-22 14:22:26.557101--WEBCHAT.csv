Could you please provide more details about the warning message you're seeing? This will help me better understand the issue and guide you accordingly. Also, having just one ad is fine; you don't necessarily need a set of them unless your campaign strategy requires multiple ads.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-22 14:24:43.561290," Thanks for sharing the details, Trudy. The warning 'No active ad sets' means that while you have created an ad, it hasn't been assigned to an active ad set. An ad set is a group of ads that share the same budget, schedule, and targeting options. To resolve this issue, you'll need to create an ad set and assign your ad to it. Here's how you can do it:
1. Go to your Ad Manager.
2. Click on 'Create Ad Set'.
3. Set up your budget, schedule, and targeting options.
4. Assign your existing ad to this new ad set.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-22 14:25:39.913237," Hi Trudy, once you've created your ad and assigned it to an active ad set, you can check its status in the Ad Manager. Here's how you can do it:
1. Go to your Ad Manager.
2. Look for the 'Status' column next to your ad.
3. If the status shows 'Approved', your ad is running.
4. If the status shows 'Pending', it means your ad is still under review.
5. If the status shows 'Rejected', there might be an issue with your ad that needs to be addressed.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-22 14:27:27.422406," Got it, Trudy. If your ad status is 'Pending', it means it's currently under review by our Ad Operations team. The ad approval process usually takes between 1-2 business days. Sometimes, it can be even quicker.
If your account is new and hasn't been verified yet, this might also cause a delay in the approval process. In that case, you may need to provide additional information for verification. You can email the following details to adsupport@newsbreak.com with the subject line: Business Verification:
- Company's full address
- Company's legal entity name
- Company's EHID or DUNS number
- Primary contact person's name
- Company's phone number
Once we receive this information, we will conduct a thorough review and update you on your account status.
For more details on the ad approval process, you can refer to this article: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad).
