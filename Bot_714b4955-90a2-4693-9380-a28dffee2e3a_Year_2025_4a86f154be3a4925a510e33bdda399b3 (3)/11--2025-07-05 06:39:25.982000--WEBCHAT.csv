bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-05 06:40:43.351792," Currently, deleting an event in Event Management is not allowed. If you no longer need an event, you can rename it with a prefix like 'DO NOT USE' to avoid confusion. This is because the event might be tied to existing campaigns or shared with other accounts, and deletion could cause issues. For more details, you can check out this article: [Pixel Deletion](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23053537846669-Introduction-to-Multi-Event-Tracking).",{}
