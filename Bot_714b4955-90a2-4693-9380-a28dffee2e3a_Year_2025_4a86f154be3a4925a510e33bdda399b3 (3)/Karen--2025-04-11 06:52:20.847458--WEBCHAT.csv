1. **Create the Event**: Log in to your NewsBreak Ad Manager account, go to 'Tools' > 'Event Management', and click on 'Create/Test web event'. Name your event and choose the type of conversion event you want to track.
2. **Set Up the Tracking**: Choose whether you want to use a Pixel or Postback for tracking. Follow the instructions provided in the Ad Manager to set up the Pixel or Postback on your website (in this case, your Etsy store). This usually involves copying a piece of code and placing it on specific pages of your site where you want to track conversions.
3. **Test and Save**: Use the ‘Go test’ feature at the bottom of the page to ensure that your tracking setup is working correctly. You should see a message indicating that the test was successful. Once confirmed, save your changes and proceed with setting up your ad campaign.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-11 16:14:46.295932," Unfortunately, Etsy does not support placing custom tracking codes like pixels directly on their marketplace pages. However, you can still track conversions by using URL parameters and tracking tools that integrate with Etsy. You can set up your NewsBreak ad campaign to include specific URL parameters that help you identify traffic coming from NewsBreak.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-11 17:12:49.049277," It looks like you need to select an event to track in order to proceed with your ad campaign setup. Even though Etsy doesn't support custom tracking codes, you can still set up a basic event to satisfy this requirement. Here's what you can do:
1. Go to 'Tools' > 'Event Management' in your NewsBreak Ad Manager.
2. Click on 'Create/Test web event'.
3. Name your event and choose a simple conversion type, such as 'Page View'.
4. Save the event without adding any custom code.
5. Go back to your ad campaign setup and select the newly created event.
This should allow you to proceed with your ad campaign without needing to place any tracking code on your Etsy store.
