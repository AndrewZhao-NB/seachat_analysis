The documentation did not mention that all other parameters are also required. Also, I tested on a few creatives and watched for a couple of hours, the header images and so on remained in place with the new clickTrackingUrl.
That is, everything looked correct. But today I see that everything is gone and only the clickTrackingUrl is left.

This is a serious problem in terms of laggy behavior. And in the API.
Does your system have a way to roll back the state of creatives to the state that was 1 day ago?
Or at least do you have logs of old",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-21 09:05:59.333693," I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're experiencing with the clickTrackingUrl and creatives. Unfortunately, our system does not currently support rolling back creatives to a previous state. However, you might want to check if there are any logs or backups on your end that could help restore the previous settings. If you continue to face issues, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
