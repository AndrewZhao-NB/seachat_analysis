bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-11 10:03:52.684506," Thanks for the information, Amir. Since you're using Tonic and you can see the postback firing from your side, let's go through some debugging steps to ensure everything is set up correctly on NewsBreak's end. Please follow these steps:
1. Make sure you've added the Callback Parameter to your ad's landing page URL.
2. Send a Postback request with your NewsBreak Click ID to our endpoint.
3. Ensure the parameter is correctly configured with your server to pass back the NewsBreak Click ID and specify the event_type.
For detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to integrate a general NewsBreak Postback](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25226963388813-How-to-integrate-a-general-NewsBreak-Postback).
