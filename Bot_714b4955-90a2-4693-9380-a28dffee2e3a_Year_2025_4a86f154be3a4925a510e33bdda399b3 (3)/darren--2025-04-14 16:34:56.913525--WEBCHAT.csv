bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-14 17:11:36.176493," Great! Let's start with setting up tracking for your ads. This is important to measure the performance of your campaigns. You can use either Pixel or Postback for tracking. Here's a brief overview of both options:
1. **Pixel**: It's easy to set up and provides insights into user behavior on your website.
2. **Postback**: It directly sends event data from your website to the Ad manager’s server (server to server). Use this when your website journey is more complicated and contains several steps.
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Go to the 'Tools' tab in your NewsBreak Ad Manager account.
2. Select 'Event Management.'
3. Choose whether you want to set up a Pixel or Postback.
4. Follow the instructions to create and integrate your tracking event.
5. Use the ‘Go Test’ feature to ensure everything is set up correctly.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [Introduction to tCPA](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17827591199757-Introduction-to-tCPA).
Once you have tracking set up, we can move on to creating your ad campaign!",{}
