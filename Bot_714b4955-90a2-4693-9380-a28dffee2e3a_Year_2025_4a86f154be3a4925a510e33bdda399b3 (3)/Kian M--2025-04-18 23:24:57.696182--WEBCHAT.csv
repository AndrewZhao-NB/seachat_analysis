I have a new top-converting offer which I'm scaling on Taboola and Outbrain.
I'm considering trying Newsbreak again but if you can explain why this happened last time:

https://shared-reports.voluum.com/?report=o5fTlcKhRjKrI5m5pdvy0g

First 2 days started strong. Ad CTRs healthy, landing page CTR healthy and conversions as well! I was happy and wanted to scale but see what happened the next days. Ad CTRs grew to unhealthy levels, landing page CTR dropped to almost none and 0 conversion! The great traffic turned into junk and everyday it got worse. What was the problem last time?",{}

I'm sorry to hear about the issues you faced with your previous campaign on NewsBreak. To better understand what might have gone wrong, could you provide more details on the following?
1. Campaign start date and duration.
2. Bidding type used (e.g., CPC, CPM, etc.).
3. Targeting settings (e.g., demographics, location, interests).
4. Budget settings and any changes made during the campaign.
5. Any recent changes in the last 72 hours before you noticed the drop in performance.
Once I have this information, I can help analyze what might have caused the drop in performance and provide guidance on how to avoid similar issues in future campaigns.
Looking forward to your response!",{}
