bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-04 12:27:42.300759," To manually fire a postback to NewsBreak from RedTrack, you need to ensure that your setup is correct. Here's a brief guide:

1. Log in to your RedTrack account and navigate to 'Traffic channels.'
2. Click '+ NEW FROM TEMPLATE' and search for NewsBreak.
3. Use the s2s URL provided: `https://business.newsbreak.com/tracking/attribute?callback={ref_id}&event_type={REPLACE}`.
4. Replace `{REPLACE}` with your actual conversion event, such as `complete_payment`.
5. Ensure that the event is set up correctly in your NewsBreak ad account by going to the 'Event Management' section and creating/testing a web event.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the full guide here: [How to set up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25515090832013-How-to-set-up-a-RedTrack-Postback-on-NewsBreak).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-04 12:30:56.389998," I'm sorry to hear that you're still having trouble. Let's go through a few troubleshooting steps:

1. **Double-check the URL**: Ensure that the s2s URL is correctly formatted and that you've replaced `{REPLACE}` with your actual conversion event.

2. **Verify RedTrack Setup**: Make sure that the NewsBreak template is correctly set up in RedTrack, and all necessary fields are filled out.

3. **Check Event Setup on NewsBreak**: In your NewsBreak ad account, ensure that the event is properly created and saved under 'Event Management'.

4. **Test Conversion Flow**: Try testing the conversion flow end-to-end to see if there are any errors or issues during the process.

If you've checked all these and it's still not working, it might be helpful to reach out to RedTrack support for further assistance or email our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your setup.",{}
