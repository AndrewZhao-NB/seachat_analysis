bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 19:34:12.961450," To record conversions on NewsBreak using the Voluum tracker, you'll need to set up a postback URL. Here's a quick guide:

1. In Voluum, go to Tracker → Traffic Sources → Create and select NewsBreak as the template. All macros are pre-set, so just click Save.
2. Create your campaign in Voluum using NewsBreak as the Traffic Source.
3. Get your Campaign URL from Voluum and add it to your NewsBreak campaign.
4. If you have custom conversions in Voluum, create relevant events in your NewsBreak account and implement each as a Traffic source postback URL per event type.
5. Test your setup by performing a test conversion to ensure everything is recorded correctly.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-24 13:31:01.767053," Let's try to figure out why you might not be getting traffic today. Could you provide some details about your campaign, such as the start date, bidding type, targeting or budget settings, and any recent changes you've made in the last 72 hours? This information will help us diagnose the issue more accurately.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-24 13:31:58.676041," Thanks for the info! Since your campaign was running properly yesterday and no changes were made, let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Learning Phase:** If your campaign is new, it might still be in the learning phase. During this time, performance can fluctuate as the system optimizes.

2. **Budget or Bidding:** Double-check your budget and bidding settings to ensure they are set correctly.

3. **Ad Schedule:** Verify if your ads are scheduled to run at specific times and if today falls outside those hours.

4. **Targeting:** Ensure that your targeting settings haven't inadvertently narrowed your audience too much.

If none of these seem to be the issue, I recommend monitoring for a few more hours as sometimes traffic can vary due to external factors. If you continue experiencing issues, please reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
