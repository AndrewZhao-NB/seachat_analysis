bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-25 20:49:07.624579," Hey there! Let's make sure your ad is running smoothly. First, check if you've received a notification about your ad being live. If not, it might still be in the approval process, which usually takes 1-2 business days. Also, ensure that you hit 'Save and Next' instead of just 'Save' when creating your campaign and ad set. If you need more detailed guidance, here's an article on creating your first ad: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad). Let me know if you have any other questions!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-25 20:50:39.104522," If your ad isn't approved by the scheduled start time, it will begin running as soon as it's approved. The system will automatically adjust to start the ad once it gets the green light. If you have any concerns or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!",{}
