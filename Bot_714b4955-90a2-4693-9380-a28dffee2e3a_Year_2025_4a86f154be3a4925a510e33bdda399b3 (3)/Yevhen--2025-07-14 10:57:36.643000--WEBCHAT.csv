It seems like you're experiencing issues with your ""Test pixel integration"" event not being marked as complete. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can follow:

1. **Confirm GTM Setup**:
   - Ensure that the Google Tag Manager (GTM) is correctly set up on your website. Check if the GTM container ID in your code matches the one in your GTM account.

2. **Check Event Tag**:
   - Make sure the `nb_purchase_subscription` event tag is properly configured. Verify that the firing triggers and variable configurations align with the event completion settings.

3. **Inspect Data Layer**:
   - Double-check whether the data layer variables are passing the correct values when the purchase occurs. This may impact the successful firing of the conversion event.

4. **Test the Integration**:
   - Ensure that you are testing the integration under the correct environment (using GTM's preview mode). Make sure the necessary events are triggered during the test.

5. **Review Custom HTML**:
   - Inspect the Custom HTML code for the pixel to ensure it’s correctly implemented. Look for any syntax errors and ensure that parameters such as `nb_value` are correctly populated.

6. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Open the browser's developer console when running the test to look for any JavaScript errors or issues preventing the pixel from firing.

7. **Ad Blockers**:
   - Sometimes ad blockers or privacy settings can interfere with pixel tracking. Make sure to test in an environment where these are disabled.

8. **Timing Issues**:
   - If the event relies on user actions, ensure that there is enough time for the event to be captured after the action takes place.

9. **Seek Further Insights**:
   - If problems persist, consider reaching out to the providers of the pixel or exploring community forums for help specific to your pixel integration.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify what might be preventing the pixel integration from completing successfully.",
