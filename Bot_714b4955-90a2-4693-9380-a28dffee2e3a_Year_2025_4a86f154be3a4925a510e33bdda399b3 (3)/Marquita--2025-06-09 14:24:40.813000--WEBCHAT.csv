bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-09 14:25:25.299227, I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with event tracking. Could you let me know if you're using Pixel Tracking or Postback Tracking? This will help me provide more specific guidance.,{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-09 14:27:08.768524," Thanks for the details! Since you're using Pixel Tracking, let's troubleshoot the pixel implementation. Could you confirm how your pixel is implemented? Are you using Custom Code, Google Tag Manager (GTM), or Shopify Integration?",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-09 14:27:38.839393," Alright, since you're using custom code, please ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL and the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place. Have you performed the action that should trigger the pixel, like simulating a purchase if it's a complete_payment event? If not, please try these steps and let me know if it helps. If the issue persists, you might want to contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-09 14:28:54.964772," Got it! For tracking events like view_content and click_button, ensure that the custom pixel code is correctly placed on the pages where these actions occur. Verify if the base pixel loads correctly on your webpage, and check if the custom event loads after going through any redirects. If everything seems correct but still doesn't work, you might want to simulate these actions again to see if they trigger the pixel. If issues persist, reaching out to adsupport@newsbreak.com could be helpful.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-09 14:31:43.726449," Unfortunately, events cannot be deleted from the dashboard. If you have old events that are no longer needed, you can rename them with a prefix like 'DO NOT USE' to help keep your dashboard organized. This way, you can distinguish between active and inactive events without causing any issues with your campaigns.",{}

I recently discovered that this token no longer populates, causing all of my subid tracking and conversion attribution to break mid-campaign.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-23 15:32:07.881939," I'm sorry to hear about the issues you're facing with your campaign. The __CALLBACK_PARAM__ is crucial for tracking, and any changes can significantly impact performance. Unfortunately, I don't have specific information on when this change was made. I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for detailed guidance and to discuss any potential ad credit due to the disruption.

They still havent addressed how they just changed how tracking is formatted on the platform without notifying advertisers with campaigns already running.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-25 12:37:12.736642," I understand your frustration with the situation, and it's important to have consistent tracking for your campaigns. While I don't have direct control over support response times, I recommend following up with them via email at adsupport@newsbreak.com to ensure your concerns are addressed promptly.
