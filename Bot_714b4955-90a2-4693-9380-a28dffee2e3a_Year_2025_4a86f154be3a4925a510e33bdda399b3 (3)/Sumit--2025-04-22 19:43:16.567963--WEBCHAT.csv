1. Go to Account Management.
2. Click 'Access' under your preferred Organization or Ad account.
3. Select 'Add User' on the right-hand side of your screen.
4. Fill in the email address of the new user and their role (Admin, Employee, Operator, or Viewer) and submit.
The new user will receive an email prompting them to make an account and verify their email. After verification, they will see your Organization or Ad account listed under their own Account Management tab.
