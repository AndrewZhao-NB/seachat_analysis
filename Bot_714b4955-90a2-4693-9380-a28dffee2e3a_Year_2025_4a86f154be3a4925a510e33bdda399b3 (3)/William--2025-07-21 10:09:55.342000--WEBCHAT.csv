bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 10:10:28.846232," Once your campaign is approved, traffic typically starts serving immediately. However, during the first few days, your ad sets will be in the learning phase. This phase usually completes after around 20-30 conversions. During this time, minimal changes should be made to allow the system to analyze performance signals and optimize audience segments and placements effectively.",{}
