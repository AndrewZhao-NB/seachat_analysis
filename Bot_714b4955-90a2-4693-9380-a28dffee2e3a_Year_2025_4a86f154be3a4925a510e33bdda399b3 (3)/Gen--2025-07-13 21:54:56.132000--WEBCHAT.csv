bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-13 21:55:45.079959," Once you've added and tested your conversion pixel, it should start tracking events almost immediately. However, it might take a little time for the data to appear in your dashboard due to processing. If you've followed all the steps correctly and used the 'Go test' feature, you should see a 'Test result: successful.' If everything is set up properly, you can expect to see data within a few hours. If you're still not seeing results after some time, double-check your setup or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-13 21:58:25.836994," Yes, after you see a 'Test result: successful,' it can take some time for the data to appear in your reports. The countdown you mentioned is likely related to a specific process or feature, but generally, data processing can take up to a few hours.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-13 22:01:42.062425," If you're not seeing the data after a successful test, let's double-check a few things:

1. Ensure that the pixel is correctly placed in the `<head>` section of your webpage.
2. Verify that the base pixel loads correctly.
3. Check if the custom event loads after going through redirects.
4. If using Shopify, make sure the pixel code is in the `theme.liquid` file and test it using Shopify's 'Test' feature.

If everything seems correct and you're still not seeing results, please contact adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your setup for further assistance.",{}
