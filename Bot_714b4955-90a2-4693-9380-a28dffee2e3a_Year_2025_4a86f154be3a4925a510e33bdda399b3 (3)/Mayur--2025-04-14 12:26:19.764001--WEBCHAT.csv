bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 18:14:28.892164," RedTrack identifies different events through the event management setup within your NewsBreak ad account. When setting up a postback, you can specify the event name and select your tracking type as 'Postback'. You then choose 'RedTrack' as the third-party tracking service and select your conversion event. This allows RedTrack to differentiate between various events based on the configuration you set in NewsBreak. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this guide: [How to set up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25515090832013-How-to-set-up-a-RedTrack-Postback-on-NewsBreak).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 18:19:39.608412," To differentiate events made for RedTrack in NewsBreak, you can use the event name and conversion event type during the setup process. When creating a postback in NewsBreak, you specify the event name and select 'RedTrack' as your third-party tracking service. This setup allows you to track specific conversion events by naming them appropriately and choosing the correct event type. You can find more detailed instructions on setting up RedTrack postbacks here: [How to set up a RedTrack Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25515090832013-How-to-set-up-a-RedTrack-Postback-on-NewsBreak).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 18:25:04.618400," Sure! Here's an example of how you can differentiate events for RedTrack in NewsBreak:
1. **Event Name**: Let's say you want to track a 'Purchase' event. You would name the event 'Purchase' when setting it up in NewsBreak.
2. **Conversion Event Type**: During the setup, select 'Postback' as your tracking type and choose 'RedTrack' as the third-party tracking service.
3. **Event Type Specification**: Specify the conversion event type, such as 'complete_payment', to clearly define what action is being tracked.
By naming your events and specifying conversion types, you can easily differentiate between different actions tracked by RedTrack in NewsBreak.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-24 18:27:26.696421," To differentiate between two events like 'debt es' and 'auto es', both having the 'submit form' event type, you can use unique identifiers or parameters within the postback URL. Here's how you can do it:
1. **Unique Event Names**: Ensure that each event has a distinct name, such as 'debt_es_submit_form' and 'auto_es_submit_form'.
2. **Custom Parameters**: Add custom parameters to the postback URL that are specific to each event. For example, you could include a parameter like `event_category=debt` or `event_category=auto`.
3. **Tracking IDs**: Use different tracking IDs or reference IDs for each event in your RedTrack setup.
By using these methods, you can clearly distinguish between similar events based on their context and additional parameters.
