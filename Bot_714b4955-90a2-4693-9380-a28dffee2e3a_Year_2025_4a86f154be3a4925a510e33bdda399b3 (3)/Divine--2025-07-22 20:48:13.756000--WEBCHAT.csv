bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 20:50:02.666999," It sounds like there might be an issue with the postback URL setup between Voluum and NewsBreak. Let's go through the steps to ensure everything is set up correctly:

1. **Check Postback URL in Voluum**: Make sure that the Traffic source postback URL in Voluum is correctly set up with the endpoint URL generated from NewsBreak.

2. **Verify Event Setup in NewsBreak**: Ensure that you've created the relevant events in your NewsBreak account and have separate URLs for each event type.

3. **Test Postback Integration**: Use the Test Postback integration feature in NewsBreak Event Manager to verify if conversions are being recorded properly.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to this [article on setting up a Voluum Postback on NewsBreak](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/24825901083277-How-to-set-up-a-Voluum-Postback-on-NewsBreak).
