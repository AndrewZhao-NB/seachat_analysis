bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-23 13:01:42.587029," It sounds like you're encountering an issue with the API integration when creating an ad. This error typically occurs if the media asset hasn't been fully processed or recognized by the system, even though it was uploaded successfully. Here are a few steps you can try:

1. **Verify Asset Processing**: Ensure that the asset has been fully processed before attempting to create an ad. Sometimes, it might take a bit longer than expected.

2. **Check Asset URL**: Double-check that the URL you're using for the asset is correct and accessible.

3. **Retry After Delay**: If possible, wait a bit longer than 10 seconds before attempting to create the ad again.

4. **Contact Support**: If the issue persists, please reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your request and any error messages received.
