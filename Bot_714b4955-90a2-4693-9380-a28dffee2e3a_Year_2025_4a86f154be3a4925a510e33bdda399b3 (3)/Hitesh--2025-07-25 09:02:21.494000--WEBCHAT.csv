bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 09:18:02.787747," It seems like your account might not yet meet the requirements to add funds directly. To enable the ad credit functionality, your account needs to complete and pass business verification, and accumulate over $5,000 in spend. Additionally, establishing a relationship with an Account Manager (AM) can help in enabling this function. If you’re transitioning from another platform and can provide evidence of top-spending accounts, an AM may assist based on past advertising history. Let me know if you’d like help getting connected with an AM or have further questions.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 09:19:07.535606," Thanks for sharing the details! It seems like reaching out to your Account Manager is indeed the best step forward. If you haven't yet established a relationship with an Account Manager, you might need to meet certain criteria, such as a daily spend threshold of $1,000 or more. If you're eligible, please provide a media plan or billing statement showing your daily ad spend. Let me know if you need assistance with this process or have any other questions!",{}
