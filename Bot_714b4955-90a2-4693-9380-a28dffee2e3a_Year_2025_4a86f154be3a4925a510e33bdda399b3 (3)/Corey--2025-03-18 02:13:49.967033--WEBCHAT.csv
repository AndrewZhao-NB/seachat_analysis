bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-18 02:14:56.963308," Hi Corey, thanks for reaching out! To redeem your ad credit, you need to create an account on NewsBreak and follow the steps outlined in our guide. Once you've created your account and set up your billing, the ad credit should be visible in your account under the Prepay option. For detailed instructions, please refer to this article: [How to redeem a NewsBreak ad credit](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17391456255629-How-to-redeem-a-NewsBreak-ad-credit).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-18 02:21:00.586086," Hi Corey, it sounds like you might be using the Autopay option instead of Prepay. If you want to switch to Prepay, you can add credits to your account manually. Unfortunately, once you've uploaded your primary payment method, you can't remove it but can update it with another card. For more details on billing options and how they work, please check out our [Billing Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17821681919757-Billing-Guide). If you're still having trouble or need further assistance, please let me know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-18 02:22:02.376649," Got it, Corey. To redeem your $500 ad credit, please follow these steps:
1. Access the Billing Section in your NewsBreak Ad Manager account.
2. Under Ad Credits, click on ‘Add ad credits.’
3. Select the amount of ad credits you would like to purchase (in this case, it should show your $500 credit).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-18 02:23:47.215127," Thanks for pointing that out, Corey. You're right. To apply for the ad credits feature, you need to submit a support ticket first. Here's what you need to do:
1. Submit a support request through the NewsBreak Help Center.
2. Once your request is approved, you'll be able to see and redeem your $500 ad credit in the Billing Section of your account.
