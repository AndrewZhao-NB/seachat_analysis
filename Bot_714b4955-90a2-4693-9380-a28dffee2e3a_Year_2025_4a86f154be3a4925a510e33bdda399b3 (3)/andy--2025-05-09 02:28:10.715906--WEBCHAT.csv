1. The URL structure is correct and includes all necessary parameters.
2. The event type in the URL matches what you have set up in NewsBreak.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-09 02:35:09.314398," To verify that your test URL is correct, follow these steps:
1. **Compare with Documentation**: Ensure the URL matches the format and parameters specified in the Digistore24 integration guide. Here's the [article](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/34801428495373-How-to-integrate-with-Digistore24) for reference.
2. **Check Parameters**: Make sure all required parameters are included and correctly formatted. Missing or incorrect parameters can cause tests to fail.
3. **Test with a Browser**: You can paste the URL into a browser to see if it returns any errors or unexpected results.
4. **Server Logs**: Check your server logs to see if the request is being received and processed correctly.
5. **Use a Tool**: Consider using tools like Postman to send requests and analyze responses, which can help identify issues with the URL or server response.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-09 02:35:44.428112," Great! Adding `cid=__CALLBACK_PARAM__` is an important step. Make sure that:
1. **Placement**: The `cid` parameter is correctly placed in the URL, typically at the end or where specified in the documentation.
2. **Encoding**: Ensure that the URL is properly encoded, especially if there are special characters.
3. **Server Handling**: Your server should be set up to handle this parameter and process it correctly.
4. **Testing**: Use a tool like Postman to test the URL and see if it returns the expected response.
If everything seems correct but you're still facing issues, double-check with your server logs to ensure it's receiving and processing the request as expected.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-09 02:37:10.913703," If you can access the URL without errors, but the test is still failing, consider these steps:
1. **Check Server Response**: Ensure your server is correctly processing the request and returning the expected response. Sometimes, the issue might be with how the server handles incoming requests.
2. **Verify Callback Handling**: Make sure that your server is set up to handle and store the `__CALLBACK_PARAM__` correctly. This parameter should be replaced with a unique ID when a user clicks on your ad.
3. **Review Logs**: Look at your server logs for any clues or errors that might indicate why the test is failing.
4. **Consult Documentation**: Double-check all steps in the [Digistore24 integration guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/34801428495373-How-to-integrate-with-Digistore24) to ensure nothing was missed.
