2. **Dynamic Token Replacement**: Make sure that `{cost}` is dynamically replaced with the actual cost value from your tracking system.
3. **RedTrack Configuration**: Verify that RedTrack is configured to pass and receive the cost parameter correctly. You may need to check RedTrack's documentation or support for specific instructions on how to set this up.
4. **Testing**: Test your postback URL to ensure that it is working correctly and passing all necessary parameters, including cost.
