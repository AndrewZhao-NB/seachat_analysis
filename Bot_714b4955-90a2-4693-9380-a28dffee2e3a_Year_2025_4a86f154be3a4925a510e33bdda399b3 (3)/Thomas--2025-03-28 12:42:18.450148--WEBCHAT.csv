bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-31 15:16:42.920168," Hi Thomas, it sounds like your ad sets might not have been activated properly. This can happen if there was an issue during the approval process or if the ad sets were not set to active status. To get a better understanding, could you please check if your ads have been approved? If they are still pending, they won't run until they are approved. You can also refer to this article for more details on creating and managing your ads: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad).
