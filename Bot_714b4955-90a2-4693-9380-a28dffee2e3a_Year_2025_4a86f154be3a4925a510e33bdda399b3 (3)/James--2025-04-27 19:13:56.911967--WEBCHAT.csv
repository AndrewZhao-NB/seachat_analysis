I have installed the NewsBreak Pixel Base Code and View Content event manually inside my Shopify site's theme.liquid file. However, my Shopify theme is older and does not support the Customer Events setup, so your Pixel Test tool is unable to verify it automatically.

The pixel is installed correctly, and the View Content event fires properly based on Shopify's product_viewed trigger.

Could you please manually verify the pixel for my account so I can complete the ad setup and launch my campaign?

Thank you very much for your help!",{}
