bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-04 21:05:53.378490, It sounds like your ad requires event tracking to optimize its delivery. Could you let me know which tracking platform or service you're using for the pixel or postback? This will help me provide more specific guidance.,{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-04 21:08:11.748726," No worries! You can set up event tracking using NewsBreak's options. Here are a few methods you can consider:

1. **JavaScript Pixel Tracking**: Implement a lightweight JavaScript pixel directly on your website to capture events in real-time.

2. **Google Tag Manager (GTM) & Shopify**: Deploy our tracking script using Google Tag Manager or integrate with Shopify's event tracking system.

3. **Server-to-Server (S2S) Postback**: For more robust tracking, especially in mobile and affiliate marketing, use Server-to-Server postbacks.

For detailed instructions, you can refer to our [Event Tracking Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25226963388813-How-to-integrate-a-general-NewsBreak-Postback). Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}
