1. **Check Platform Capabilities**: See if the print-on-demand platform offers any built-in analytics or tracking features.

2. **Contact Support**: Reach out to the platform's support team to inquire about integrating third-party tracking solutions like NewsBreak.

3. **Use Available Integrations**: Some platforms may offer integrations with popular analytics tools that can be linked to your NewsBreak account.

4. **Collaborate with Platform Owners**: If possible, collaborate with the website owners to implement tracking solutions that benefit both parties.

If these options aren't available, you might need to rely on other marketing strategies within the platform's capabilities. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with!",{}
