Is there a best practices list before we setup our first campaign here? Exclusion lists? Campaign setup strategy? Funnel types that crush on this ad platform?

Can you share any best practices before we start so we can get through the learning curve fast?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-25 17:51:59.603671," Hey Justin! Great to hear you're setting up your funnels and pixels. NewsBreak has some best practices that can help you get started smoothly:

1. **Campaign Setup Strategy**: Use the 1-2-3 structure: 1 campaign per product, 2 ad sets (test out both max conversion and tCPA), and 3 ads per ad set. This helps our algorithm optimize effectively.

2. **Targeting**: Start with broad targeting initially by selecting 'unlimited' to cast a wider net, which helps identify users most likely to convert.

3. **Creative Strategies**: Static images and GIFs perform best in 16x9 format, while video ads perform best in 9x16 format.

4. **Funnel Types**: High-performing funnels often guide users from awareness to conversion using creative strategies tailored to NewsBreak’s audience profile—typically 45+, slightly more female, homeowners, car owners, and parents.

5. **Exclusion Lists**: While specific exclusion lists aren't mentioned, it's important to continuously test and refine your targeting based on performance data.

For more detailed guidance, check out our [Maximize Conversions Best Practices](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23055076590221-Maximize-Conversions-Best-Practices) article.
