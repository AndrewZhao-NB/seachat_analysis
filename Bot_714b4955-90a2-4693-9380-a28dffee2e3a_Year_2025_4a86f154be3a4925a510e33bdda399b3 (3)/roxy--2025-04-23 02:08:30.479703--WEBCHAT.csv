bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-30 00:12:35.843768,"Thanks for providing the campaign details. Since your campaign is showing as active but not running, it might be due to a few reasons:
1. **Verification**: If your account is new, your business might not be verified yet. Please ensure that all necessary business verification details are submitted.
2. **Budget and Bidding**: Double-check your budget and bidding settings to ensure they align with your campaign goals.
3. **Targeting Settings**: Review your targeting settings to make sure they are not too narrow, which could limit ad delivery.
4. **Recent Changes**: If you've made any recent changes, it might take some time for the system to update and start delivering ads.
If everything seems correct and the issue persists, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

1. **Campaign Start Date:** Ensure that the start date is set correctly and has already passed.
2. **Bidding Type and Budget:** Verify if your bidding type and budget settings align with your campaign goals.
3. **Targeting Settings:** Double-check your targeting settings to ensure they are not too restrictive.
4. **Recent Changes:** If you've made any changes in the last 72 hours, it might take some time for those changes to reflect.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-30 00:13:20.794300," Thanks for sharing the status updates. It looks like there have been some changes to the campaign status recently. Here are a few things to consider:
1. **Status Changes:** Ensure that the campaign is currently set to 'ON' and not 'OFF'. If it's 'ON', it should be active.
2. **Objective:** Your campaign objective is set to WEB_CONVERSION, which means it should be optimized for conversions.
3. **Recent Status Updates:** Since the status was changed from OFF to ON on April 28, 2025, it might take a little time for the system to start delivering ads.
