bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-02 02:42:15.503788," Sure, I can help with that! To transfer ownership to a new email, you need to grant access to the new user for your Ad account. Here are the steps: 
1. Access Account Management.
2. Switch over to the 'Ad Accounts' tab.
3. Click ‘Access’ under your preferred Ad account.
4. Select ‘Add User’ on the right-hand side of your screen.
5. Fill in the email address of the new user and their Ad account role (Admin, Operator, or Viewer) and submit.
Once submitted, the new user will be prompted to follow a link via their email for verification. After verification, they will see your Ad account listed under their own Account Management tab.
For more details, you can refer to this article: [Account Management Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17539290349709-Account-Management-Guide).",{}
