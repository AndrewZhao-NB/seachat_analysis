bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 22:35:41.750121," To set up a NewsBreak Pixel with Google Tag Manager (GTM), follow these steps:

1. **Install NewsBreak Pixel base code on GTM**
   - Log in to your Google Tag Manager account and select the Workspace for your website.
   - Click the 'Tags' option in the left-hand sidebar and then click the 'New' button.
   - Give this tag a meaningful name (e.g., NewsBreak Pixel Base Code), then click on the box to open a list with all available tag types, and a blank text box will appear.
   - Log into your NewsBreak Ad Manager account, go to Tools -> Event Tracking to create an event with Pixel, and choose to integrate with GTM and your event type. You can also turn on Event value if you have a value associated with this event. Code and instructions will be generated after you fill all required fields.
   - Copy the NewsBreak Pixel base code under section 1.
   - Return to GTM from step 3 and paste the NewsBreak Pixel base code into the text box.
   - Click the save button in the upper-right corner to save the base tag.

2. **Install NewsBreak Pixel conversion code**
   - In your NewsBreak Ad Manager Event Tracking Tool, copy the NewsBreak Pixel conversion code under section 2.
   - Paste this conversion code into a new Custom HTML tag in GTM.
   - Create a trigger for when you want this conversion event to fire (e.g., clicking on a certain button).

3. **Test if NewsBreak Pixel is installed correctly**
   - You can test it either in GTM or with the NewsBreak Ad Manager Event Tracking Tool by triggering your conversion event on your webpage. Ensure both base code tag and conversion tag are shown under Tags Fired in GTM or see successful test results in NewsBreak Ad Manager Event Tracking Tool.",{}
