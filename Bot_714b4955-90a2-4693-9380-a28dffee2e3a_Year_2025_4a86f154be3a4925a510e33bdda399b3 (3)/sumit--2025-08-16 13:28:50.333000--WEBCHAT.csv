bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-16 13:50:38.669041," It seems like your account might not yet be eligible to add ad credits directly. To become eligible, your account needs to complete and pass business verification, and accumulate over $5,000 in spend. Additionally, you’ll need to establish a relationship with an Account Manager who can request the ad credit functionality for you.

If you believe this is an error or need further assistance, please contact our Ad Support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com. They'll be happy to help resolve this issue.",{}
