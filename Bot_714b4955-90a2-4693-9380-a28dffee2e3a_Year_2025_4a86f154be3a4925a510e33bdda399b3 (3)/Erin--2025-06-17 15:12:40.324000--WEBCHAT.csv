1. **Refresh the Page:** Sometimes, simply refreshing the page can fix display issues.

2. **Clear Cache and Cookies:** Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, as this can help with loading issues.

3. **Check Browser Compatibility:** Ensure you're using a compatible browser, such as Chrome or Firefox, which are generally recommended for optimal performance.
