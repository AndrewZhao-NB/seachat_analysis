bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-08 20:27:57.188406," When you adjust bids on a tCPA campaign, it can take some time for the campaign to stabilize. Typically, the Cold Start Period is completed within the first 2-5 days of your campaign. During this phase, our system gathers crucial learnings about user behavior, helping identify the most likely converting audience segments for your campaign. You should expect daily fluctuations during this time. Once enough data is collected, you will see more stabilized performance. It's recommended to be patient and refer to weekly data for optimization rather than making frequent changes.",{}
