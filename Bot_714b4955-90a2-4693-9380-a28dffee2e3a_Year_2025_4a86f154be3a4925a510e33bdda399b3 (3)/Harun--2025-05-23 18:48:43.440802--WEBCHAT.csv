bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-26 08:07:28.676118," To exclude desktop users completely, you can set your targeting preferences to focus solely on mobile devices.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-26 14:47:23.965770," To target users who have never clicked on your ad before, you can use exclusion targeting.

This will help ensure that your ads are shown to new users only. If you need more help with setting this up, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-27 15:38:05.942757," Yes, if you've set up an audience based on ad engagement, such as clicks, new users who click on your ad will automatically be added to this audience. This allows you to continuously update and exclude these users from seeing your ad again. Make sure your audience settings are configured to dynamically include new engagements for this to work effectively.",{}
