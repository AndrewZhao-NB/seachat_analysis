bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-07 15:06:19.691070," Hi Nicolas! Let's see if we can figure this out together. Are you using Pixel Tracking or Postback Tracking for your events? Also, could you let me know how you've implemented the pixel, like whether you're using custom code, Google Tag Manager (GTM), or Shopify integration?",{}
web,WEBCHAT,552ebdc51ee44a15a345fe323b80d08e,Nicolas ,2025-07-07 15:07:15.852232,"The event I'm having trouble with is a pixel event, installed via GTM",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-07 15:07:34.790083," Thanks for the details, Nicolas! Let's go through some steps to troubleshoot your pixel event with GTM:

1. **Check Pixel Installation**: Ensure that the NewsBreak Pixel base code is correctly installed in your GTM account.
2. **Verify Event Setup**: Make sure you've created an event in the NewsBreak Ad Manager and integrated it with GTM.
3. **Test the Pixel**: Use GTM's Preview mode to test if both the base code and conversion tag are firing correctly when you trigger the conversion event on your website.
4. **Check Triggers**: Ensure that the correct triggers are set up for your conversion events in GTM.

If you've gone through these steps and still face issues, please let me know! You can also refer to this [guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/14333966189581-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-with-GTM) for more detailed instructions.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-07 15:08:33.663472," It's great to hear that everything is firing correctly! There can sometimes be a delay in the reporting of conversions on the ads dashboard. Typically, it might take a few hours for the data to sync and appear. If it's been more than 24 hours and you're still not seeing the conversions, there might be another issue at play.

In such cases, double-check your event setup in the NewsBreak Ad Manager to ensure everything is configured correctly. If you continue to experience issues, please reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-08 09:26:58.937106," It sounds like you're experiencing issues with event tracking on News Break. Since the events are working well on other native channels, let's check a few things:

1. **Event Type**: Ensure that the event type selected in your tracking platform matches the one set up in News Break.
2. **Postback URL**: Double-check that the Postback URL is correctly configured and active.
3. **Event Management**: Verify that the event is properly set up in News Break's Event Management tab.
4. **Conversion Reporting**: Make sure you have enabled multi-event tracking and reporting if applicable.

If you've checked these and still face issues, please provide more details about your setup or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

During this time, the ad may not be active. Once approved, it should resume normal performance. It's always a good idea to monitor your ad's performance after making changes.",{}
