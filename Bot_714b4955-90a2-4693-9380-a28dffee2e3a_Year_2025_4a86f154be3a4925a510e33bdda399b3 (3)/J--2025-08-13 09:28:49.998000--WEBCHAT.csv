bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-13 09:29:37.973387," Hi there! It sounds like you're experiencing a 404 error related to a Git upload. This usually means that the server couldn't find the requested resource. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Verify URL:** Make sure the URL you're trying to access is correct.
2. **Check Server Configuration:** Ensure your server is configured properly and the resource exists.
3. **Git Repository:** Double-check your Git repository settings and ensure all files are correctly uploaded.

If you need more specific help, feel free to provide additional details!",{}

Doing a test it works, passes the test. But on real camp doesnt. 

I see clicks in tracker, but not in NB dashboard.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-15 02:28:56.915190," It sounds like you're experiencing issues with your pixel tracking setup. Let's troubleshoot this together! Since your test passed but real campaign data isn't showing, here are a few steps to consider:

1. **Verify Pixel Placement**: Ensure the base pixel code is correctly placed on your landing page URL and the custom pixel code is on the event page where the user action takes place.

2. **Check Event Configuration**: Double-check that the event is configured correctly in your tracking platform and NewsBreak Ad Manager.

3. **Test Real User Actions**: Perform real user actions that should trigger the pixel, like clicking a button or viewing content, to see if it fires.

4. **Tracking Platform Check**: If clicks are recorded in your tracking platform but not conversions, ensure that the postback is set up correctly and check with your offer provider if these events constitute conversions.

5. **Contact Support**: If you've verified all settings and still face issues, grab the click ID and timestamp for conversions from your tracking platform and email adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.
