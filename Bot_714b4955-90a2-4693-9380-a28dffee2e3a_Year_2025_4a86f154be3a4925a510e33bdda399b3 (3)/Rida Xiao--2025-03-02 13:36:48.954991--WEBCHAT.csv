Is there something wrong with this ad or is the traffic limited because of the low balance in the account?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-28 11:56:38.348567," Hi Rida, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with your ad. There could be several reasons why your ad isn't receiving traffic after reopening it. Here are a few things you can check:
1. **Launch Date:** Ensure that the launch date at the ad set level is correct. Ad Manager uses PST/military time, so sometimes campaigns are set to start at a later time than expected.
2. **Budget Adjustments:** During the learning phase, it's recommended not to make too many changes as this can cause fluctuations in performance. Try increasing your budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days.
3. **Account Balance:** While a low balance might affect your campaign's ability to run continuously, it shouldn't completely stop traffic unless there are insufficient funds for ongoing bids.
For more detailed guidance, you can refer to our FAQ article: [NewsBreak FAQ](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/20333724725133-How-to-create-separate-ad-accounts).
If you need further assistance or if these steps don't resolve your issue, please email our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
