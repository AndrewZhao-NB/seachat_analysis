It looks like you're encountering an ""Invalid operation"" error when trying to test your postback integration. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check the URL**: Ensure that the URL you're using meets the required format. It should include the `__CALLBACK_PARAM__` placeholder.

2. **Test Functionality**: Make sure the landing page URL is responsive and correctly set up on your website. You might want to load it in your browser to verify it's accessible.

3. **Verify Parameters**: Ensure that any parameters appended to the URL (like `utm_medium`) are correctly formatted and not interfering with the callback parameter.

4. **Reach Out to Support**: Since the message suggests reaching out to your Account Manager, it might be beneficial to do so if the error persists after checking the above points. They could provide more specific assistance based on your account and setup.

5. **Documentation Review**: Revisit the documentation for setting up postbacks to confirm that all steps were followed correctly.

If you need more help, feel free to share additional details!",
