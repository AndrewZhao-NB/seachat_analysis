bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 00:40:09.599436," Thanks for letting me know, Alicia! To install a NewsBreak Pixel on your Weebly website, you can follow these general steps. Unfortunately, we don't have a specific guide for Weebly, but the process is similar to other platforms like Shopify or GTM. Here’s a basic outline you can follow:
1. **Get Your Pixel Code**: Obtain your pixel code from NewsBreak Ad Manager.
2. **Access Weebly Editor**: Log in to your Weebly account and go to the website editor.
3. **Add Custom Code**: Navigate to the 'Settings' tab and select 'SEO'. In the 'Header Code' section, paste your pixel code.
4. **Save and Publish**: Save your changes and publish your site.
For more detailed information on setting up custom pixels, you can refer to this [article](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18551604763405-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-on-Shopify). Although it's for Shopify, the steps are quite similar.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 00:40:55.010377," Great question, Alicia! To locate your pixel code in the NewsBreak Ad Manager, follow these steps:
1. **Log In**: Log into your NewsBreak account.
2. **Navigate to Tools**: Go to the 'Tools' section and select 'Ad Manager'.
3. **Event Management**: Click on 'Event Management'.
4. **Choose Pixel**: Select 'Pixel' as your tracking type and choose your integration method (e.g., Shopify, GTM, etc.). Specify your event type.
5. **Get Base Code**: Your base code will be generated after you fill in all the required fields. Copy this code.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 01:05:56.063329," In the pixel code, you should replace `xxx` with the actual value you want to track for that event. For example, if you're tracking a purchase event, you might replace `xxx` with the purchase amount. Here's an example:
```javascript
{nb_value: 49.99}
```
This would track a value of $49.99 for that specific event.
If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 01:06:55.647825," Yes, you can add more than one value to your pixel code by including additional parameters within the code. For example, if you want to track both the purchase amount and the currency, you can do something like this:
```javascript
{nb_value: 49.99, currency: 'USD'}
```
This way, you are tracking both the value of the purchase and the currency used.
If you need more detailed guidance or have any other questions, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 01:07:31.425133," Got it, Alicia! If you want to track multiple purchase amounts, you would typically send separate events for each purchase. Each event would have its own `nb_value`. Here's an example of how you might do this in your pixel code:
```javascript
// First purchase event
{nb_value: 49.99}
// Second purchase event
{nb_value: 29.99}
```
Each of these events will be tracked separately with their respective values.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 01:09:55.431259," I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble finding your web event. Let's try a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:
1. **Refresh the Page**: Sometimes, simply refreshing the page can help display the latest changes.
2. **Check Filters**: Make sure there are no filters applied that might be hiding your event. Look for any filter options and clear them if necessary.
3. **Log Out and Log In**: Try logging out of your NewsBreak account and then logging back in to see if the event appears.
4. **Recreate the Event**: If you still can't find it, you might need to recreate the event. Follow the steps again in Event Management to create and save your web event.
For more detailed instructions on creating multiple events, you can refer to this [article](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27390924095245-Understanding-Custom-Columns-and-Web-Events).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 22:37:58.897200," I'm sorry to hear that your checkout pixel isn't working properly. Let's try to troubleshoot this issue. Here are some steps you can follow based on the platform you're using for your pixel implementation:
1. **Custom Code**:
   - Ensure the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
   - Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page (where the user action takes place).
   - Perform the action that should trigger the pixel (e.g., simulate a purchase if it's a checkout event).
   - If the pixel doesn't fire, double-check your code and try these steps again.
2. **Google Tag Manager (GTM)**:
   - Verify that your GTM container is published and includes the correct tags and triggers for your pixel.
   - Use GTM's preview mode to test if the tag fires correctly when performing a checkout action.
3. **Shopify Integration**:
   - Ensure that the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify.
   - Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
   - For a complete_payment event, simulate a product purchase to verify the setup.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 22:39:00.936547," I understand, Alicia. Let's try to troubleshoot the issue with your conversion pixel on the checkout page. Here are some steps you can follow based on your setup:
1. **Custom Code**:
   - Ensure that the base pixel code is correctly added to your landing page URL.
   - Verify that the custom pixel code is placed on the checkout page where the user action takes place.
   - Perform a test action (e.g., simulate a purchase) to trigger the pixel and see if it fires correctly.
   - If it still spins, double-check your code for any errors or missing elements.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 22:44:20.555406," Thanks for the details, Alicia. Since you're using a Weebly website through Square and have already placed the codes in the tracking section, let's try a few more steps to troubleshoot the conversion pixel issue:
1. **Verify Placement**: Ensure that the conversion pixel code is placed correctly in the tracking section of your Weebly site. It should be within the `<head>` tags if possible.
2. **Check for Errors**: Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible by pressing F12) to check for any JavaScript errors on your checkout page that might be preventing the pixel from firing.
3. **Simulate Conversion**: Perform a test checkout to see if the conversion pixel fires. You can use tools like Facebook Pixel Helper or Google Tag Assistant to verify if the pixel is working correctly.
4. **Debugging Guide**: Refer to this [Event Tracking Debugging Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18551604763405-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-on-Shopify) for more detailed troubleshooting steps, even though it's for Shopify, it might provide some insights.
