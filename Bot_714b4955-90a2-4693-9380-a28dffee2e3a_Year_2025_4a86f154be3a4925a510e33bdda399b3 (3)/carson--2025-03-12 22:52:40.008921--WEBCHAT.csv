bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 22:53:21.797247," Yes, you can view the pixel code of an event you have already created. If you're using Shopify, you can go to Settings > Customer events in your Shopify account to see the pixel code. For other platforms like Google Tag Manager (GTM) or custom code implementations, you would need to access the respective platform where you set up the pixel. If you need detailed steps for a specific platform, let me know which one you're using!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 22:54:04.736248," Got it! To view and edit the pixel code inside the NewsBreak dashboard, you can follow these steps:
1. Log into your NewsBreak account.
2. Navigate to Tools > Ad Manager > Event Management.
3. Choose Pixel as your tracking type and select the event you want to view or edit.
4. You should be able to see the base code and any custom code associated with that event.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 22:55:08.491606," I apologize for any confusion. If you are unable to view the pixel code of an already created pixel directly within the NewsBreak dashboard, you might need to refer to the original setup instructions or documentation where the pixel code was initially provided. Unfortunately, if the platform does not support viewing or editing existing pixel codes directly, you may need to create a new pixel and use that code instead.
