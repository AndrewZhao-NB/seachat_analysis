The specific reason for your ad rejection should have been communicated to you via email from Ad Support. If you haven't received any details, I recommend checking your inbox for an email from adsupport@newsbreak.com. For more information on what to do next after an ad rejection, you can refer to this article: [My ad got rejected.

To determine if the rejection is due to the ad or the landing page, please check the rejection email or notification you received from NewsBreak. It should specify the reason for rejection.
