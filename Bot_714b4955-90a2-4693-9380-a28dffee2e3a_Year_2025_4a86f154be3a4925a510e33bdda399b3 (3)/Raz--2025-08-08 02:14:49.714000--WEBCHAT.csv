bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-08 02:15:41.753135," Let's troubleshoot the issue with your pixel tracking. Could you please confirm if you're using a custom code on your website, Shopify, or Google Tag Manager (GTM)? Also, have you placed the base pixel code correctly in the `<head>` section of your webpage? If the base pixel loads correctly, we need to check if the custom event loads after you go through any redirects. Let me know these details so I can assist you further.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-08 02:16:35.938928," Thanks for confirming that you're using custom code. Please ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL and the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel, such as a purchase if it's a complete_payment event. If the pixel doesn't fire, try these steps again. If you continue to face issues, you might want to contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
