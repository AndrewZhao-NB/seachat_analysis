bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-13 16:09:57.741255," Hey Sunni! You can set up both a web pixel and a server postback to report a form submission. However, it's important to note that sending duplicate conversion events might affect your reporting and algorithm. We recommend keeping both the old and new Postbacks to avoid impacting your current campaign performance. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to reach out!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-13 23:17:58.443106," It's generally better to avoid sending duplicate conversion events from both a web pixel and a server postback if it might lead to discrepancies in your reporting or affect the algorithm. If you choose to use both, ensure that they are set up correctly and monitor the results closely. If you notice any issues, you might want to adjust your setup accordingly.",{}
