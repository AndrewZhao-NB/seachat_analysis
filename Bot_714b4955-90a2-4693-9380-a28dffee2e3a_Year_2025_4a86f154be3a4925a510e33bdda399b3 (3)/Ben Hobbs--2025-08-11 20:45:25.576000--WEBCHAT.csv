bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 20:46:43.243912," It sounds like you're having trouble with the conversion snippet of your NewsBreak Pixel. Let's go through a few steps to troubleshoot this:

1. **Verify Placement**: Ensure that the conversion code is placed correctly on the page where the conversion event occurs. It should be in the `<head>` section if you're using custom code.

2. **Check Triggers**: If you're using Google Tag Manager (GTM), make sure that the trigger for your conversion event is set up correctly and matches the action you want to track.

3. **Test Conversion Event**: Perform the action that should trigger the conversion event (e.g., completing a purchase) to see if it fires.

4. **Debugging Tools**: Use GTM's Preview mode or NewsBreak Ad Manager's Event Tracking Tool to test if both base and conversion codes are firing correctly.

If you've checked these and it's still not working, you might want to refer to our detailed guide on setting up pixels with GTM here: [How to install a NewsBreak Pixel with GTM](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/14333966189581-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-with-GTM).

It  is in the <head> section but when i test it, it's 2-3 min in and still hasn't found it",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 20:51:15.325340," Thanks for the details! Since you're using custom code and have placed the conversion snippet in the `<head>` section, let's try a few more things:

1. **Ensure Correct Event Type**: Double-check that the event type in your conversion snippet matches the action you want to track (e.g., `complete_payment`).

2. **Network Requests**: Use your browser's developer tools (usually accessible with F12) to check if there are any network requests being blocked or errors in the console that might prevent the snippet from firing.

3. **Test with Different Browser**: Sometimes, browser extensions or settings can interfere. Try testing on a different browser or in incognito mode.

4. **Check for JavaScript Errors**: Look for any JavaScript errors on your page that might be preventing scripts from executing properly.

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it might be helpful to reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of your setup and any error messages you see.
