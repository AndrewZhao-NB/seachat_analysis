bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-12 10:30:34.101448," I'm sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your credit card. If your card payment failed and you have already contacted your bank, I recommend trying to add a different payment method to your account. Once you update your account with a new payment method, don't forget to resubmit your ads! Another short-term solution is to add ad credits to your account. For more details, you can check out our Billing Guide here: https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17821681919757-Billing-Guide",{}
