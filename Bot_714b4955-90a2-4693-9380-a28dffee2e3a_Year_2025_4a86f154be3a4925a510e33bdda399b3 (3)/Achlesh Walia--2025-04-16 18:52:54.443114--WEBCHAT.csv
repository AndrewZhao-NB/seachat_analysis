bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-16 18:54:25.313675," Got it! To create rules to pause your campaigns, you'll need to use the automated rules feature in the NewsBreak Ad Manager. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set it up:
1. Go to your Ad Manager dashboard.
2. Navigate to the 'Automated Rules' section.
3. Click on 'Create Rule'.
4. Set the conditions for when you want your campaigns to be paused (e.g., based on performance metrics like CPC, CPA, etc.).
5. Choose the action 'Pause Campaign' when these conditions are met.
6. Save your rule.
This will ensure that your campaigns are automatically paused based on the criteria you set.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to our Account Management Guide here: [Account Management Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17539290349709-Account-Management-Guide).",{}
