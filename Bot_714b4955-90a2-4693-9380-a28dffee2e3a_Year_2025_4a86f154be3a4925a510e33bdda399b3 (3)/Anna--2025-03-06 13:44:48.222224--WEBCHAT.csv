bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-06 13:46:03.592213," To ensure that you have integrated AppsFlyer events and they are being tracked on NewsBreak, follow these steps:
1. **Get Tracking URLs**: Go to 'Integrated Partners' on AppsFlyer and search for NewsBreak. Select 'Attribution Link' under 'NewsBreak' and retrieve your tracking URLs.
2. **Configure In-App Events**: Enable the in-app event postbacks and use NewsBreak event_type for mapping. Make sure to include values & revenue on AppsFlyer if you toggle on the Event value.
3. **Check Conversion Data**: For iOS, deactivate the advanced policy to ensure NewsBreak can receive all conversion data.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [Introduction to App Install Events](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/26530008151309-Introduction-to-App-Install-Events).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-06 13:47:13.536332," If you have followed the steps and still don't see any installs on your campaigns, you can check if NewsBreak is receiving data from your application by doing the following:
1. **Verify Tracking URLs**: Ensure that the tracking URLs are correctly implemented in your app and that they match the ones provided by AppsFlyer.
2. **Check Event Postbacks**: Make sure that the in-app event postbacks are enabled and correctly mapped to NewsBreak event types. Verify that values & revenue are included if toggled on.
3. **Review Conversion Data Settings**: For iOS, ensure that the advanced policy is deactivated so NewsBreak can receive all conversion data.
4. **Contact Support**: If everything seems correct but you still don't see any data, it might be helpful to contact NewsBreak support for further assistance.
