bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-26 00:53:47.856181," If your ad got rejected, don't worry! You should receive an email from Ad Support with the subject line ‘Urgent: Ad Rejected - Action Required.’ This email will detail the specific reason for rejection. Make sure to review the bolded reject reason carefully and address that specific issue. For example, if your headline was over the character limit, revise it to 90 characters or less. Once you've made the necessary revisions, resubmit your ad by saving it again.

If you believe your ad complies with the policies or if the rejection was a misunderstanding, you can submit an appeal by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com.
