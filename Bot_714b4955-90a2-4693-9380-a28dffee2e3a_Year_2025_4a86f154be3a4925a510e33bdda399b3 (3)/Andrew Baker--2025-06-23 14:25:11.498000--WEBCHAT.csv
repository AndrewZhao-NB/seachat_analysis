Quick question: can we add multiple organizations with different addresses, credit cards, and LLCs to the same account, or would we need to create a separate account for each one?

Thanks,
Andrew",{}

You can manage multiple organizations under one account in NewsBreak's Ad Manager. Each organization can have its own set of ad accounts and campaigns, which allows you to use different addresses, credit cards, and LLCs for each organization. You don't need to create a separate account for each one.

For more details on managing multiple organizations and ad accounts, you can check out our [Account Management Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17539290349709-Account-Management-Guide).

Let me know if you have any other questions!",{}
