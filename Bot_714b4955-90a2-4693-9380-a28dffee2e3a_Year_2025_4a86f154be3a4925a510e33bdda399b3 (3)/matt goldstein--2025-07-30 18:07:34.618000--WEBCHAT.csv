I have tried putting the code on the my thank you page after the order is placed and that did not work. The wheel just keeps spinning when I test it,{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-30 18:08:40.748074," It sounds like you're having trouble with setting up the pixel event tracking. Let's go through some steps to troubleshoot this. 

1. **Verify Pixel Placement**: Make sure that the base pixel code is correctly placed in the `<head>` section of your webpage, and the custom event code is on the thank you page where the order is completed.

2. **Check Event Type**: Ensure that you are using the correct event type for your tracking needs, such as `complete_payment` for purchase events.

3. **Test Purchase**: If it's a purchase event, try making a test purchase to see if it triggers the pixel.

4. **Use Test Feature**: If you're using Shopify, use their 'Test' feature to ensure that the custom event fires correctly.

5. **Debugging Steps**: If these steps don't resolve your issue, please check if your tracking platform records clicks but not conversions. You may need to contact adsupport@newsbreak.com with details like click ID and timestamp for further assistance.
