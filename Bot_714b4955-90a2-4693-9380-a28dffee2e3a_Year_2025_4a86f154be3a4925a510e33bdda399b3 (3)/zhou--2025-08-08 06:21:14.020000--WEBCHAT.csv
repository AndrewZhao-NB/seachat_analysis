1. **Daily Budget**: You have set a daily budget of $100, but there's a recommendation for a minimum daily budget of $150. It's often beneficial to follow these recommendations to ensure optimal performance and give the algorithm enough room to optimize effectively.

2. **Bid Type**: You're using the 'maximize conversions' bid type with a bid rate of $15. This is great for focusing on conversion goals, but keep in mind that costs can fluctuate around this rate.

3. **Schedule and Optimization**: Make sure your schedule aligns with when your target audience is most active, and consider increasing the budget during peak periods if possible.

4. **Save Your Settings**: Don't forget to click 'Save and Next' after making any changes to ensure they're applied.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-08 06:24:08.349812," When deciding between focusing on the cost per conversion (tCPA) or cost per click (CPC), it depends on your advertising goals:

1. **Cost Per Conversion (tCPA)**: If your primary goal is to drive conversions, such as sales or sign-ups, you should focus on the expected advertising fee for converting one order. This approach helps optimize your budget towards achieving specific conversion goals.

2. **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: If you're aiming to increase traffic to your website or raise brand awareness, focusing on CPC might be more suitable. This model charges you for each click your ad receives.

Yes, in the interface you provided, the ""Device"" section is likely where you should be able to specify the type of devices you want to target. 

If there is an option labeled under ""Device"" that allows you to select between desktop (PC) and mobile, you can make your choice there. However, if you're not seeing specific options to choose the device type, it might be that the feature is not available in your current setup, or it could be located in another part of the interface.
