3. **Creative Testing**: Experiment with different ad creatives to see which ones perform better and drive down costs.

4. **Targeting Adjustments**: Start with broad targeting and refine it based on performance data after the learning phase.

5. **Monitor Performance Weekly**: Analyze performance on a weekly basis rather than daily to get a clearer picture of trends and make informed adjustments.

6. **Use Bid Estimation Tool**: Utilize the bid estimation tool for ad sets labeled as ""Learning Phase Complete"" to identify high growth potential and optimize bids accordingly.
