bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-28 08:58:48.048424," Thanks for confirming that your postback URL is set up correctly. Since you're still seeing duplicate conversions, here are a few additional steps to troubleshoot the issue:
1. **Verify Unique Click IDs:** Ensure that each conversion event has a unique NewsBreak Click ID (`newsbreak_cid`). Duplicate Click IDs can cause multiple conversions to be recorded for the same click.
2. **Check Timestamp:** If possible, include a timestamp in your transaction ID to ensure uniqueness.
3. **Review Logs:** Check your server logs to ensure that the postback requests are being sent correctly and only once per conversion event.
4. **Contact Support:** If you've verified all the above and still see duplicates, it might be helpful to contact NewsBreak support for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-28 09:00:47.094482," Thanks for checking the Click IDs. To deduplicate conversions on NewsBreak or track only one conversion per Click ID, you can follow these steps:
1. **Use the dedupe parameter:** Ensure that the dedupe parameter is set to 1 in your postback URL, which you have already done.
2. **Pass a unique transaction ID:** Use a timestamp or another unique identifier as the transaction ID to ensure each conversion is unique.
3. **Limit conversions per Click ID:** You can configure your tracking setup to limit conversions to one per NewsBreak Click ID (`newsbreak_cid`). This might require adjustments on your tracking platform (Clickflare) to ensure it only fires one conversion per Click ID.
