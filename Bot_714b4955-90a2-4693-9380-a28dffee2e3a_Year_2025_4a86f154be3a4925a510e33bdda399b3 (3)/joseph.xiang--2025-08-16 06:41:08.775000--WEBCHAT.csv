bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-16 06:45:38.916307," Once your service is live with an official HTTPS certificate, you should be able to whitelist your domain to handle cross-domain requests without needing a proxy. Ensure that your server settings allow for cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) by properly configuring the whitelist for your domain. If you encounter any issues, double-check your CORS settings or consult with your technical team.",{}
