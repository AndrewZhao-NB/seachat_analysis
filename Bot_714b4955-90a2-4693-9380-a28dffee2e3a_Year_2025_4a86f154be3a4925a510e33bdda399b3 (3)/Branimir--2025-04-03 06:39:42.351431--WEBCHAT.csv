We set up a Maximize conversion campaign, the results were good, the learning phase was successfully completed. After that, we switched the campaign to Target CPA, but the campaign literally stopped. There are no clicks or impressions. We switched the campaign back to maximize conversion but still nothing happens. Can you help us?",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-03 07:01:26.039031," Hi Branimir, it sounds like you're experiencing issues with your campaign after switching from Maximize Conversions to Target CPA and then back. Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:
1. **Check the Learning Phase**: Ensure that your campaign is not stuck in the learning phase again after switching back to Maximize Conversions. It might need some time to readjust.
2. **Review Your Budget**: Make sure your budget is sufficient for the Maximize Conversions strategy. Sometimes, increasing the budget can help kickstart the campaign.
3. **Optimize Your Creative**: If your actual CPA exceeds your expected CPA, consider optimizing your creative to boost the CTR or adjusting your target audience.
4. **Duplicate Ad Set**: You can try duplicating the ad set as it sometimes yields different results, but proceed with caution as it resets the learning phase.
