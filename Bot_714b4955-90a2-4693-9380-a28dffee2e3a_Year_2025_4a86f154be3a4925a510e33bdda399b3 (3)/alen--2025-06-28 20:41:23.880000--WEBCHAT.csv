bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-28 20:42:20.751085," It sounds like you've set up everything correctly on the RedTrack side, but the conversions aren't appearing in your NewsBreak dashboard. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Verify Postback URL**: Ensure that the postback URL is correctly configured in RedTrack. It should match the format provided by NewsBreak.

2. **Check Event Type**: Make sure that the event type in your postback URL is correctly specified and matches what you've set up in NewsBreak.

3. **Test Conversion Flow**: Use the test feature to ensure that conversions are being tracked end-to-end.

4. **Click ID and Timestamp**: If RedTrack is recording conversions but they aren't showing on NewsBreak, gather the click ID and timestamp for those conversions and contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 15:47:14.218494," If your conversions are showing up in RedTrack and ClickBank but not on the NewsBreak dashboard, it might be due to an issue with the postback setup or data transmission. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Postback URL Configuration**: Ensure that the postback URL is correctly configured in RedTrack to send conversion data to NewsBreak.
2. **Click ID Passing**: Make sure that the Click ID is being passed correctly through all redirects to ensure accurate tracking.
3. **Event Setup**: Verify that your event is set up correctly in NewsBreak's Event Management. You can use the ‘Go Test’ feature to check if conversion events are being received.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 15:48:54.883879," Great to hear that the event setup for 'Complete_payment' was successful! Since the test was successful but you're still not seeing conversions in the NewsBreak dashboard, it might be a delay in data syncing or an issue with how the data is being displayed. Here are a few steps you can take:

1. **Check Data Sync**: Sometimes there can be a delay in data syncing between platforms. Give it some time and check back later.
2. **Dashboard Filters**: Ensure that there are no filters applied on your NewsBreak dashboard that might be hiding the conversion data.
3. **Re-verify Postback URL**: Double-check that the postback URL is correctly set up and matches what is required by NewsBreak.
