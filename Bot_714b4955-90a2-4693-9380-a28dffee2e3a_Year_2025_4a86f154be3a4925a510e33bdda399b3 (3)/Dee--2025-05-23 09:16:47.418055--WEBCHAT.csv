This will give you an idea of how ads are positioned and optimized for performance. Unfortunately, there isn't a direct way to view all active ads, but understanding the ad formats can help you create effective advertisements.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-23 09:21:11.013482," That's correct, there isn't a library or feature on NewsBreak where you can view all existing running ads. However, you can use the ad creation tools to preview different ad formats and placements, which can give you insights into how ads are typically displayed. If you have any other questions or need help with creating your ad, feel free to ask!",{}
