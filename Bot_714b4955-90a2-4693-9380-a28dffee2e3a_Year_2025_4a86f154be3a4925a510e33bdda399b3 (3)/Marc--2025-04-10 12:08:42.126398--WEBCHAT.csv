bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-10 13:31:04.790459," I'm sorry to hear that the conversion tracking event is not being checked when testing. Let's troubleshoot this issue step-by-step:
1. **Verify Script Placement**:
   - Ensure that the conversion event code is correctly placed on the redirection landing page where the user lands after completing the desired action.
   - The script should look like this:
```
<!-- Track conversion event, please use EXACT 'event', 'complete_registration' in the code below -->
<script>
  nbpix('event','complete_registration', {nb_value: xxx});
</script>
```
2. **Check for JavaScript Errors**:
   - Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12) and check for any JavaScript errors in the console that might be preventing the script from running.
3. **Network Requests**:
   - In the developer tools, go to the Network tab and look for any requests being made to NewsBreak's tracking URL when you perform a test conversion.
4. **Correct Parameters**:
   - Ensure that all parameters (`clickid`, `conversionid`, `amount`, `eventtype`) are correctly passed and match what is expected by NewsBreak.
5. **Test with Different Browsers**:
   - Sometimes browser-specific issues can cause problems. Test your setup in different browsers to see if it works elsewhere.
6. **Contact Support**:
   - If you have followed all these steps and still face issues, please contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details about your setup and any error messages you see.
