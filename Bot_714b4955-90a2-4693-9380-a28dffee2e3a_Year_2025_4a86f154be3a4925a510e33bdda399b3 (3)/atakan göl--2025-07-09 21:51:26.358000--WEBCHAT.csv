bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 21:55:02.804636," It sounds like you might be encountering an issue with the permissions associated with your API access token. When you create an API access token, the permissions are typically set based on your user role and account settings. To resolve this, I recommend checking if your token has the necessary permissions for accessing campaign data.

If you're unsure about how to verify or modify these permissions, please contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance. They can help ensure that your token is configured correctly.

For more details on API integration, you can refer to our [API Integration Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27680147056397-API-Integration-Guide).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 22:01:23.083237," For running a synchronous report using the endpoint you mentioned, your API access token needs to have reporting permissions. Even if your account is set as admin, the API token itself must be granted specific permissions to access different endpoints.

To ensure you have the correct permissions, please verify that your API token includes reporting access. If you're unsure how to check or update these permissions, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for assistance.

You can also refer to our [API Integration Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27680147056397-API-Integration-Guide) for more information on setting up and managing API tokens.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-09 22:02:19.587204," If your API token has the `createReport` permission, it should generally allow you to run reports. However, if you're still encountering issues, there might be other factors at play such as specific endpoint restrictions or additional permissions required.

I recommend double-checking the API documentation for any additional permissions that might be needed for running synchronous reports. If everything seems in order and you're still facing issues, please contact our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance. They can help troubleshoot the problem more thoroughly.",{}
