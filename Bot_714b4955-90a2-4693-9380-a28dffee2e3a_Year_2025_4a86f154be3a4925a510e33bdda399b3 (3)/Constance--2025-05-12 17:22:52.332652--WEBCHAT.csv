bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-12 17:24:00.653537," Hey there! Setting up your first ad campaign can be a bit tricky, but I'm here to help. On the Event page, you'll need to create and test web events. Make sure you enter the event name, select your tracking type as ‘Postback’, and choose your third-party tracking service if applicable. If you're using RedTrack, there's a specific guide for that. You can find more detailed instructions in our Help Center article on creating your first ad: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad). Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-12 19:32:21.989159," No worries, I can help with that! To add code for tracking a conversion event, you'll need to integrate either a Pixel or Postback. Here's a quick guide:
1. **Pixel**: This is a small piece of code you place on your website to track user actions like purchases. It's generally easier to set up and provides insights into user behavior.
2. **Postback**: This method sends event data directly from your website to the Ad Manager's server (server-to-server). It's useful for more complex website journeys.
Make sure you test the setup using the 'Go Test' feature in Event Management to ensure everything is working correctly.
