bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-20 18:57:52.027572," Hey there! It sounds like you might be experiencing an issue with duplicate clicks. Could you confirm if you're seeing these duplicate clicks in your tracking platform? If so, are they at the same timestamp and from the same user? If you can provide samples of the click logs from your tracking platform, that would be really helpful. Once you have that information, we can look into it further.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-20 18:58:38.216110," Got it! If News Break is showing more clicks than your tracker, it might be due to discrepancies in how clicks are recorded. Sometimes, tracking platforms may filter out certain clicks based on their criteria, such as bot traffic or invalid clicks. Could you check if your tracking platform has any filters or settings that might affect click recording? If everything seems fine on your end, you can reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of the discrepancy for further investigation.",{}
