bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-03 17:30:08.575100," Got it! For custom integrations, it's important to ensure that the postback is set up correctly. Here's a general guide on integrating a NewsBreak Postback:

1. Add the Callback Parameter to Your Ad's Landing Page URL by inserting `__CALLBACK_PARAM__` into the landing page URL of your ad.
2. Verify if the custom event is placed correctly and fires as expected.
3. Use any available test features in your platform to load and verify the event.

If everything seems fine but you're still facing issues, please check if your tracking platform is recording clicks and conversions properly. If not, you might want to reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com with details like click ID and timestamp for further assistance.
