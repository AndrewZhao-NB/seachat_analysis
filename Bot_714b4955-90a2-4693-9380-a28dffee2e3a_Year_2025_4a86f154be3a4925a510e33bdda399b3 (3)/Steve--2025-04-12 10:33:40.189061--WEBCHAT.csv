bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-12 10:34:24.209187," Good morning! The character limits for titles and descriptions can vary depending on the ad format. To ensure your message is fully visible across all formats, it's best to keep your title under 30 characters and your description under 90 characters.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-17 09:26:32.042488," Good morning! For BizOpps and work-from-home offers, you should choose the 'Online services and utilities' industry for your ad account.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-25 09:48:39.558729," It seems like you're asking about lookalike audiences. Lookalike audiences are a type of audience targeting that allows advertisers to reach new people who are likely to be interested in their business because they share similar characteristics with their existing customers. This feature is often used for expanding reach and finding potential new customers. If you have more specific questions or need guidance on creating lookalike audiences, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-25 09:50:11.935005," Currently, NewsBreak does not support lookalike audiences directly. However, you can create custom audiences by uploading a CSV file with user identifiers like email addresses or device IDs. This allows you to target users who have already engaged with your business.
