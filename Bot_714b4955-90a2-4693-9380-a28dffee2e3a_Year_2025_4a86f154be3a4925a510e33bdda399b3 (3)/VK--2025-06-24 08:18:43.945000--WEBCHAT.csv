1. **Check Postback URL:** Ensure that the postback URL is correctly set up in RedTrack. It should match the format provided by NewsBreak.

3. **Callback Parameter:** Make sure that the Click Ref ID field has the correct callback parameter as specified by NewsBreak.

4. **Campaign Settings:** Double-check that your campaign settings in both platforms are aligned, especially regarding traffic sources and offers.
