web,WEBCHAT,5f9e1ac65a42465a8de9e4abb190fc3b,Christian ,2025-07-01 13:36:36.669640,custom code,{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-01 13:36:47.936793," Thanks for letting me know you're using custom code. Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel, such as simulating a purchase if it's a complete_payment event.
4. Check if the pixel fires correctly after performing these actions.

If you've tried these steps and are still facing issues, please contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.
