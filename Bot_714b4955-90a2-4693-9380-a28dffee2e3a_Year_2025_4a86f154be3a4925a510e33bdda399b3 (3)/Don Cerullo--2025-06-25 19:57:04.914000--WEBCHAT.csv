bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-25 19:58:56.057847," Hi there! To increase your daily budget from $20 to $500, it's important to do it gradually to maintain stable performance. We recommend increasing your budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days. So, you could increase it to $30 first, then monitor the performance for a few days before making further increases. This approach helps the system optimize effectively without causing fluctuations in performance. Let me know if you need any more help!",{}
