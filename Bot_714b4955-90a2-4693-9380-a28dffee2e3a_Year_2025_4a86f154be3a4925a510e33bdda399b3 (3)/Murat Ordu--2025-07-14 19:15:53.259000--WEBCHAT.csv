I would like to manually add ad credit using my credit card — for example, $300 or $1,000.

Automatic payments are not ideal for me, because after every $10 charge, my credit card may get blocked due to security reasons. That’s why I prefer to make a manual payment before running ads.

Could you please enable this option for my account?

Thank you.",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-14 19:17:27.508015," Hi Murat, thanks for reaching out! Currently, the ad credit functionality is not available for newly created accounts by default. To enable this option, your account must complete and pass business verification and accumulate over $5,000 in spend. Once these conditions are met, you can establish a relationship with an Account Manager who can request the ad credit functionality to be enabled for you. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to contact our Ad Support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
