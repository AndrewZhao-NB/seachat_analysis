bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-18 15:33:52.952099," Great question! Once you set up the postback correctly on Clickflare, it becomes a universal tracking tool accessible to all the campaigns within that advertising account. So, you can use the same postback for multiple campaigns within your Clickflare account. If you need more detailed instructions, feel free to check out this article: [How to Integrate a NewsBreak Postback with Clickflare](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/28421919800845-How-to-Integrate-a-NewsBreak-Postback-with-Clickflare).",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-18 15:34:04.375669," When you set up a postback for a specific campaign on ClickFlare, it is typically configured to track conversions for that particular campaign. If you have multiple campaigns and want to track conversions for each one, you'll need to set up individual postbacks for each campaign. This ensures that the conversion data is accurately attributed to the correct campaign. If you need detailed instructions on how to integrate a NewsBreak postback with ClickFlare, you can refer to this article: [How to Integrate a NewsBreak Postback with Clickflare](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/28421919800845-How-to-Integrate-a-NewsBreak-Postback-with-Clickflare).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-18 15:37:24.270255," Ah, got it! On NewsBreak, once you have set up a postback correctly, it can be used as a universal tracking tool for multiple ads within the same advertising account. You don't need to create a new postback for each campaign or link. Just ensure that your initial setup is correct, and it will work across your campaigns.",{}
