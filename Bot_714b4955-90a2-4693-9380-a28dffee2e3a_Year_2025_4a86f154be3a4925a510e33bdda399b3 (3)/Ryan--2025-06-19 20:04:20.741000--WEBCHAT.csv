bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-19 20:05:27.006870," If the transaction history only shows 'card' without specifying which card was used, you might need to check the 'Payment Methods' section in your account settings. This section should list all cards associated with your account, and you can cross-reference the transaction dates with the cards listed there.
