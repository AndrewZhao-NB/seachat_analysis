2. **Engaging Content**: Create native-style images that spark curiosity and engagement. 
3. **Video Length**: Keep videos between 15-30 seconds for optimal engagement, but if you want to go longer, consider directing users to a landing page.
4. **A/B Testing**: Experiment with different creative angles like testimonials or product showcases, and keep the old ads running alongside new ones for comparison.
