bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-05 13:03:31.950576," It sounds like you're having trouble with your pixel setup. Let's try to resolve this step by step. 

1. **Verify Installation**: First, ensure that both pixels are correctly installed on your website. You can do this by checking the code snippets on your site and making sure they match the ones provided in the NewsBreak Ad Manager.

2. **Check Event Management**: In the NewsBreak Ad Manager, navigate to Tools >> Event Management again and see if both pixels appear after refreshing the page.

3. **Accessing Pixel Details**: To access details for a specific pixel, you should be able to click on it within the Event Management section to view its settings and associated events.

If you've followed these steps and still can't see or access your second pixel, there might be an issue with how it's set up or displayed in the system. I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com with details of both pixel IDs for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-05 13:05:12.898705," To find the pixel code itself, you can follow these steps:

1. **Log into NewsBreak Ad Manager**: Go to Tools >> Event Management.

2. **Select Your Pixel**: Find the pixel you want to access and click on it.

3. **Locate the Code**: Once you're in the pixel's settings, there should be an option to view or copy the base code and conversion code for that pixel.
