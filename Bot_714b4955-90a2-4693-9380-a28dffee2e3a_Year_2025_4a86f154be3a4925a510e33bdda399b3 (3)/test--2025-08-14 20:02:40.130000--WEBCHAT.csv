bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-14 20:04:19.026009," Thanks for the info! To troubleshoot your pixel tracking issue with custom code, please follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel. For example, if it's a complete_payment event, simulate purchasing the product to trigger the pixel.
4. If the pixel doesn't fire, try these steps again.

If you continue to have issues, feel free to contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
