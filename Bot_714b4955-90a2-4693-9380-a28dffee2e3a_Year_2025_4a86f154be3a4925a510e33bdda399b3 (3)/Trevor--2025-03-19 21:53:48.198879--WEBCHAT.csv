Here's a step-by-step guide on how to integrate Newsbreak with CPV Pro and ensure cost data is included:
1. Log in to your CPV Pro account.
2. Navigate to the 'Postback URL' section in your tracking settings.
3. Make sure you have included the correct parameters for cost data in your postback URL.
4. The parameter for cost should be set as `&cost={cost}` or similar, depending on CPV Pro's requirements.
5. Save your changes and test the integration to ensure that cost data is being passed correctly.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-31 16:31:15.994443," Thanks for the details! Having only one ad live shouldn't necessarily stop your campaign from spending. Here are a few things you can check to troubleshoot the issue:
1. **Launch Date and Time**: Ensure that the launch date and time at the ad set level are correct. Remember, Ad Manager uses PST/military time, so double-check if your campaign is set to start at a later time.
2. **Budget Adjustments**: If you've recently made changes to your budget, it might affect performance. During the learning phase, it's suggested not to make too many changes and increase the budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days.
3. **Payment Method**: Verify that you have a valid payment method associated with your account, even if you are using ad credits.
If none of these seem to be the issue, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-31 18:43:21.495289," If your ad set is marked as 'learning progress slow,' it can affect the performance and spending of your campaign. During the learning phase, it's normal to see fluctuations in performance. Here are a few tips to improve the learning progress:
1. **Increase Budget Gradually**: Avoid making drastic changes to your budget. Increase it by no more than 50% every 2-3 days.
2. **Add More Creatives**: Consider adding more creatives to your ad set. Testing 3-5 ads per ad set is recommended, especially if your budget is below $200.
3. **Review Targeting and Bidding Strategy**: Adjust your targeting and bidding strategy if necessary.
4. **Monitor Performance Weekly**: Since our model optimizes with a 7-day average CPA goal, review weekly performance to make adjustments.
