bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-04 20:54:55.138749," Got it! To test your pixel integration, make sure you've followed these steps:

1. Log in to your Ad Manager account and go to Tools > Event Management.
2. Click on 'Create/Test web event' and set up your event.
3. Use the 'Go test' feature at the bottom of the page to ensure that the test result is successful.

If you're still having trouble, please check if the tracking platform is recording the click. If it is but not showing a conversion, verify with your offer provider if the event constitutes a conversion.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this [Event Tracking guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/23053537846669-Introduction-to-Multi-Event-Tracking). Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}
