bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-27 16:17:36.656805," Thanks for the details, Kristin. Starting with a $10 daily budget is a good approach to test interest. Since your ad set is in the learning phase and hasn't received any clicks, it might need some adjustments to improve performance. Here are a few suggestions based on best practices:
1. **Increase Budget Gradually**: Consider increasing your daily budget by 50% every 2-3 days to help the system gather more data and find the right audience.
2. **Review Targeting Options**: Ensure your targeting options are well-defined and relevant to your audience. Avoid making drastic changes frequently as it can disrupt the learning process.
3. **Optimize Creative Assets**: Test different creative assets (images, videos) and separate them into different ad sets if possible.
4. **Be Patient During Cold Start Period**: The Cold Start Period typically lasts 2-5 days, during which the system gathers crucial learnings about user behavior.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-27 16:18:35.398326," I understand your concern, Kristin. Since your ad set hasn't gathered enough data yet, it can be challenging to make decisions. Here are a few steps you can take to help the system gather initial data:
1. **Increase Budget Slightly**: Even a small increase in budget can help the system gather more data. Consider increasing your daily budget from $10 to $15 and monitor the performance for a few days.
2. **Check Ad Creative and Copy**: Ensure that your ad creative and copy are engaging and relevant to your target audience. Sometimes tweaking the visuals or messaging can make a big difference.
3. **Expand Targeting Options**: If your targeting is too narrow, try broadening it slightly to reach a larger audience.
4. **Monitor Performance Regularly**: Keep an eye on the performance metrics daily but avoid making frequent changes as it can disrupt the learning phase.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-27 16:18:47.159249," Got it, Kristin. If your ad set isn't showing any money spent or activity, there might be an issue with the setup. Here are a few things to check:
1. **Launch Date and Time**: Ensure that the launch date and time are set correctly. Sometimes campaigns are set to start at a later time due to time zone differences.
2. **Ad Approval**: Verify that your ad has been approved and is not under review or disapproved for any reason.
3. **Targeting Settings**: Double-check your targeting settings to ensure they are not too restrictive, which could limit the audience reach.
4. **Ad Creative**: Make sure your ad creative meets all guidelines and is properly uploaded.
If everything seems correct and there's still no activity, you might want to try pausing and then reactivating the ad set to reset it.
