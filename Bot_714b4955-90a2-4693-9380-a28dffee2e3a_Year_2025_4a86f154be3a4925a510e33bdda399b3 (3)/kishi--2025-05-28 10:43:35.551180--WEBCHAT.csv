bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 10:45:29.105252," To help you with the tracking link format, could you please specify which tracking platform or service you're using? This will allow me to provide you with the most accurate information.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 10:50:33.319010," For integrating Google Analytics with News Break, you can use UTM parameters to track your campaigns. Here's a basic format for the tracking link: 

`https://www.yourwebsite.com/?utm_source=newsbreak&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=your_campaign_name`

Make sure to replace `yourwebsite.com` and `your_campaign_name` with your actual website URL and campaign name. If you need more detailed instructions, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 10:53:59.363037," Yes, you can modify the last character to use `&utm_campaign=campaign_name` in your tracking link. Here's how it would look:

`https://www.yourwebsite.com/?utm_source=newsbreak&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=campaign_name`

Just ensure that each parameter is separated by an ampersand (`&`) and replace `campaign_name` with your actual campaign name.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 10:57:29.387763," Yes, you can include additional parameters in your tracking link to track your account ID and campaign name. Here's an example of how you might structure it:

`https://www.yourwebsite.com/?utm_source=newsbreak&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=campaign_name&utm_content=account_id`

Replace `campaign_name` and `account_id` with your actual campaign name and account ID. This way, Google Analytics will capture these details for better tracking.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-30 02:38:27.494613," There could be several reasons why your ad isn't showing even after passing the review. Let's check a few things: 

1. **Campaign Start Date**: Ensure that the campaign start date is set correctly and has already begun.
2. **Bidding Type**: Verify if the bidding type is appropriate for your campaign goals.
3. **Targeting or Budget Settings**: Double-check your targeting settings and budget to ensure they align with your campaign objectives.
4. **Recent Changes**: If you've made any changes in the last 72 hours, it might take some time for those changes to reflect.

If everything seems correct and it's still not showing, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
