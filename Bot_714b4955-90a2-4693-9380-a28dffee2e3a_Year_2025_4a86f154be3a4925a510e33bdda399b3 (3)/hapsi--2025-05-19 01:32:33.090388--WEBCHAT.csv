bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-19 01:33:35.587877," Got it! Let's troubleshoot both methods. 
For the NewsBreak Pixel with GTM:
1. Ensure that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel, like completing a payment if that's your event type.
4. If it doesn't fire, try these steps again or contact adsupport@newsbreak.com if issues persist.
For Shopify:
1. Check that the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify.
2. Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly by simulating a product purchase for a complete_payment event.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-19 01:33:38.010014," Let's troubleshoot this together! Since you've tried both NewsBreak Pixel and GTM, let's go through some debugging steps:
1. **For NewsBreak Pixel:**
   - Ensure the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
   - Make sure the custom pixel code is placed on the event page where the user action takes place.
   - Perform the action that should trigger the pixel (e.g., simulate a purchase if it's a complete_payment event).
2. **For GTM:**
   - Check that you've installed the NewsBreak Pixel base code correctly in GTM.
   - Ensure triggers are set up properly for both base and conversion tags.
   - Use GTM's Preview mode to test if both tags fire correctly when you perform the conversion event on your website.
