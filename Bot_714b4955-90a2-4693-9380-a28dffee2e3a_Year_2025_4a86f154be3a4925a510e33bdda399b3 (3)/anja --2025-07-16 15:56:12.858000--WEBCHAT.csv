bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-16 15:58:24.516316," It sounds like your campaign requires event tracking to function properly. Event tracking is essential for conversion event bidding strategies, which help optimize your ad performance. Without it, the system might not be able to track conversions effectively, leading to issues with your ad running.

To set up event tracking, you can use either a Pixel or Postback method. The Pixel is generally easier to set up and provides insights into user behavior. If your website journey is more complex, you might consider using Postback.

For more detailed guidance on setting up event tracking, you can refer to our [Event Tracking Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17827591199757-Introduction-to-tCPA). Let me know if you need further assistance!",{}
