bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-28 20:33:58.252045," Let's try to figure out why your ad isn't showing any activity. Could you please check the following details for me?
1. **Campaign Start Date**: Make sure the campaign start date is set correctly in the ad manager, as it operates in PST/military time.
2. **Bidding Type**: Verify that your bidding type is set up correctly.
3. **Targeting or Budget Settings**: Double-check your targeting and budget settings to ensure they align with your campaign goals.
4. **Recent Changes**: Have there been any changes made to the campaign in the last 72 hours?
Once you've reviewed these factors, let me know if you need further assistance!",{}
