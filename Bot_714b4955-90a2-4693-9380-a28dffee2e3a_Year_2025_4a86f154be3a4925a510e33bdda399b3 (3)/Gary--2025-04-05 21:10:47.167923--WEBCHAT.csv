bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-05 21:12:34.672942," Thanks for letting me know, Gary! Here are the steps to troubleshoot your pixel issue on Shopify:
1. Ensure the customer event is correctly configured in Shopify.
2. Test the event in both Shopify and NewsBreak to ensure it triggers correctly.
3. For a complete_payment event, simulate a product purchase to verify the setup.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to install a NewsBreak Pixel on Shopify](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18551604763405-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-on-Shopify).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-05 21:14:01.381590," Got it, Gary. Since the first part of the event passes, let's ensure the custom pixel code is correctly placed on the event page where the user action takes place. Here are some steps to follow:
1. Verify that the base pixel code is added to your landing page URL.
2. Ensure that the custom pixel code is placed on the event page (where the user action takes place).
3. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel again.
