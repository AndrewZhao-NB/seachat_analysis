If you’re not at that level yet, our self-serve platform has everything you need to launch and optimize your campaigns successfully. For increasing your ad account threshold, please ensure that your account completes and passes business verification and accumulates over $5,000 in spend. Once these conditions are met, you can establish a relationship with an Account Manager who can assist further. If you have any questions or need help getting started, feel free to reach out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
