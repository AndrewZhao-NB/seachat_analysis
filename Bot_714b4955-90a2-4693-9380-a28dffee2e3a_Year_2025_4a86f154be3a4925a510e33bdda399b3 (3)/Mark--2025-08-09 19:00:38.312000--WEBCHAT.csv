bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-09 19:01:21.912926," Hey there! Yes, you can be billed monthly. NewsBreak offers two main billing options: Autopay and Prepay. With Autopay, you store a credit card on file and are charged when the billing threshold is met or at the end of the month. Prepay allows you to add credits to your account before running ads. For more details, check out our Billing Guide here: [Billing Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17821681919757-Billing-Guide). Let me know if you have any other questions!",{}

3. Adjust the 'Video' settings to lower the bitrate if needed.
4. Click 'Start Encode' to compress your video.
