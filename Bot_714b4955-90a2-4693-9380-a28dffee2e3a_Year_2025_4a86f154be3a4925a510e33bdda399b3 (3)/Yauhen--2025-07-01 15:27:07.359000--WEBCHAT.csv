I'm not able to directly assist with reviewing or approving ads. However, I can suggest that you carefully review the advertising policies for the platform where your ads were rejected. Look for any specific reasons mentioned for the rejection, as this could help you identify areas for modification.

You might also consider reaching out to the support team of the advertising platform. Provide them with details, including the campaign ID and the reasons for rejection, to request a re-evaluation of your ads. Ensure to emphasize that the creatives have been accepted on other platforms, which might support your case for approval.",
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-01 15:49:54.272880," I'm sorry to hear about the issues with your ads. While I can't directly review or approve ads, I recommend checking out our ad policy compliance guidelines to ensure your creatives align with NewsBreak's standards. You can find more information here: [Ad Policy](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25362604231053-Ad-Policy).

If you believe your ads comply with the policies or if the rejection was a misunderstanding, you can submit an appeal by emailing adsupport@newsbreak.com. Make sure to include your campaign ID and any relevant details in your email.
