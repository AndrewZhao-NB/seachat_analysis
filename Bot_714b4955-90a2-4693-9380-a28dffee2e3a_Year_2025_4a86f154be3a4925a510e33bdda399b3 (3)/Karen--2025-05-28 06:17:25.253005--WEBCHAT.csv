bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 06:18:36.809162," Great! For Shopify integration, make sure you've placed the NewsBreak Pixel code correctly in the theme.liquid file. You can follow these steps:

1. Log into your Shopify account and go to Settings > Customer events.
2. Create a unique name for your pixel.
3. Click 'Add pixel' to open the event editor.
4. Paste your custom JavaScript pixel code into the Code window.
5. Ensure that the pixel is set up for the correct event type, like 'complete_payment'.
6. Test the event using Shopify's 'Test' feature to ensure it triggers correctly.

If you need more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to install a NewsBreak Pixel on Shopify](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/18551604763405-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-on-Shopify).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 06:19:27.948003," That's great to hear! Now, let's ensure the custom event is loading correctly. Here are a few steps you can follow:

1. Verify that the custom event code is placed correctly on the event page where the user action takes place.
2. Perform the action that should trigger the pixel, such as simulating a product purchase if it's a 'complete_payment' event.
3. Check if the pixel fires correctly after performing the test action.

If everything is set up correctly but you're still facing issues, try these steps again or reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 06:20:15.653882," If the test for your conversion event tracking code isn't completing, here are a few things to check:

1. Ensure that the tracking platform is recording the click correctly.
2. Verify if the event constitutes a conversion with your offer provider.
3. If the tracking platform is counting a conversion but NewsBreak isn't completing the test, grab the click ID and timestamp for the conversion from your tracking platform.
4. Send this information to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further investigation.

These steps should help identify where the issue might be occurring.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-28 06:26:40.890848," Yes, that's correct! The timestamp for the conversion is typically the time when the order or conversion event was recorded by your tracking platform.
