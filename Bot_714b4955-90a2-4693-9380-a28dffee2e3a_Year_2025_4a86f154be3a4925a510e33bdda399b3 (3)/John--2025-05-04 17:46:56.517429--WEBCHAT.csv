bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 17:48:11.425217," If your conversion tracking code is placed on a redirect URL after a form submission, it should still be able to track the event as long as the tracking code is properly executed on that redirect page. The key is ensuring that the tracking code fires correctly when the user lands on the redirect URL. If you're using a postback method, make sure that the callback parameter is included in your ad's landing page URL and that it's passed through to the redirect URL.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 17:49:28.848378," If you're using the install code method, make sure that the NewsBreak Pixel or tracking code is correctly placed on the redirect URL where you want to track the conversion event. The pixel should fire when a user lands on that page, capturing the conversion data.
If you need specific instructions for setting up your pixel, please let me know which platform you're using (e.g., Shopify, GTM), and I can provide more detailed guidance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 17:51:01.391841," Thanks for clarifying! If the NewsBreak tracking code is only on the redirect URL and not on the initial landing page, it should still track conversions as long as the user reaches that redirect page after submitting the form. The key is ensuring that the tracking code executes properly on that redirect URL.
However, keep in mind that without any tracking code on the initial landing page, you might miss out on capturing other valuable data like page views or user interactions before they submit the form. If your goal is solely to track conversions post-form submission, your current setup should work.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 18:16:57.572477," Running ads non-stop can increase the chances of reaching more users and potentially gaining more conversions, but it might not always be the most efficient strategy. Setting a schedule that aligns with your team's ability to follow up with leads promptly can improve conversion rates, as timely follow-ups often lead to better engagement.
Regarding the time of day for the highest volume of leads, it generally depends on your target audience and industry. Many advertisers find success during peak hours when their audience is most active online, such as early morning or late afternoon. However, it's best to analyze your past campaign data to identify patterns specific to your audience.
Consider testing different schedules and monitoring performance metrics to find what works best for your campaigns.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-04 18:18:18.062271," When increasing your ad budget, a good rule of thumb is to do so gradually to maintain stable performance. For NewsBreak ads, it's recommended to increase the budget by no more than 50% every 2-3 days. This allows the system to adjust and optimize without causing fluctuations in performance.
Since you're targeting multiple locations across the U.S., make sure your budget is sufficient to gather enough data for each location. This will help in optimizing your campaigns effectively.
If you notice that your campaign is performing well and meeting your goals, you can continue with gradual increases while monitoring the results closely.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-15 17:39:46.313965," Thanks for letting me know you're using the Newsbreak Pixel. Here are a few things you can check:
1. Ensure that the pixel is correctly implemented on your website and is firing as expected.
2. Verify that the events are being captured in real-time.
3. If you're testing events, make sure the test completes successfully.
4. If conversions are not updating, check if the tracking platform is recording clicks but not conversions.
If you've checked these and still face issues, please grab the click ID and timestamp for the conversion from your tracking platform and send an email to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.
