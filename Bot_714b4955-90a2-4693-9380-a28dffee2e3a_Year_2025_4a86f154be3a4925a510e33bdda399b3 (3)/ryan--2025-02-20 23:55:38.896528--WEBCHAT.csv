One of the key options is Custom Audience targeting, which allows you to reach users who already know or have engaged with your business. This is great for retargeting and creating look-alike audiences. If you want more detailed information, check out our Audience Management guide here: [Introduction to Audience Management](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/26679465558669-Introduction-to-Audience-Management).
