bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-07 12:10:35.454567," Sure thing! I can help you set up web events using BeMob as your tracker. Here are the steps you need to follow:
1. Log into your NewsBreak account and head to Event Management, then click 'Create/Test Web Event.'
2. Select the Event Type and whether or not you want to pass a value back.
3. Copy this Postback URL for NewsBreak: `https://business.newsbreak.com/tracking/attribute?callback=xxx&event_type=complete_registration&nb_value=xxx`
4. Switch tabs to BeMob and create a new traffic channel for NewsBreak (if not created already) and use the following details for the template:
   - The Parameter needs to be populated by our click id macro i.e., `__CALLBACK_PARAM__`.
   - Double-check that your Postback URL is filled in with the correct endpoint.
5. Click 'Save' and head to Campaigns to create a new campaign.
6. Select NewsBreak as your traffic source, fill in the Offer details (selecting the Offer), and hit Save.
7. Head to the newly created campaign and hit the ‘Actions’ button.
8. When the dropdown populates, click 'Copy URL.' This would copy the Campaign URL which should look something like this: `https://click.bestautoinsuranceclub.com/go/7e6c17f6-c030-4000-b3bb-079d4263971e?CALLBACK_PARAM=__CALLBACK_PARAM__&__CAMPAIGN_ID__=__CAMPAIGN_ID__&__CAMPAIGN_NAME__=__CAMPAIGN_NAME__&__FLIGHT_ID__=__FLIGHT_ID__&__FLIGHT_NAME__=__FLIGHT_NAME__&__CREATIVE_ID__=__CREATIVE_ID__& __CREATIVE_NAME __ = __ CREATIVE_NAME __ & __ OS __ = __ OS __`
9. Switch back to NewsBreak's Event Management tab and enter this URL in the Test URL field.
10. Hit ‘Go Test’ and you should be redirected to the Offer landing page, where you need to follow the steps to complete the conversion (In this case, complete a registration form).
11. Once you complete the conversion event on this landing page, we should receive a success message from BeMob, completing the Event Testing.
