For example the endpoint for getting all campaigns is this ""https://business.newsbreak.com/business-api/v1/campaign/getList"", with my access token i get error code 403.  Also I can't find anywhere in the API and endpoint that includes getCampaignList",{}
bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-27 11:01:40.215735," It sounds like you're having trouble accessing the API endpoints with your token. Error code 403 usually indicates a permission issue. First, ensure that your access token is correctly set in the HTTP Header as 'Access-Token'. If you haven't already, you might want to check if your token has the necessary permissions for accessing campaign data. You can refer to our API Integration Guide for more details on setting up and authenticating your API requests: [API Integration Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27680147056397-API-Integration-Guide). If you're still facing issues, please contact adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-27 11:02:49.478966," To update your API access, you need to ensure that your token has the correct permissions. You can generate a new token by logging into the NewsBreak Ad Manager Platform. Navigate to Tools - Resources - API Access Tokens, and click 'Generate token' to create a new access token. Make sure this token is tied to your user ID and should not be shared with anyone else. If you need further assistance, feel free to reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
