bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 18:50:23.231235," Hi there! There could be several reasons why your ad isn't getting any impressions. Let's break it down:

1. **Campaign Start Date**: Check if the campaign is set to start at a later date or time.
2. **Bidding Type**: Ensure that your bidding strategy aligns with your campaign goals.
3. **Targeting or Budget Settings**: Review your targeting options and budget to make sure they are set correctly.
4. **Recent Changes**: If you've made any changes in the last 72 hours, it might take some time for the system to adjust.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 18:53:07.249795," To help pinpoint the exact issue with your ad impressions, could you provide more details?

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-22 18:53:32.019934," Thanks for the info! Since there haven't been any changes, let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Targeting Settings**: Double-check your audience targeting to ensure it's not too narrow.
2. **Budget**: Make sure your budget is sufficient to compete in the ad auction.
3. **Ad Approval**: Verify that your ad has been approved and is active.
4. **Cold Start Period**: If this is a new campaign, it might be in the Cold Start Period where the system is learning about user behavior.

If none of these seem to be the issue, I recommend reaching out to our support team at adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
