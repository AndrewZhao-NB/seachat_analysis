bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-12 04:17:33.424182," Thanks for providing the details! Since your campaign started on May 7, 2025, and it's set to pay by impression with a bid rate of $4.00, let's check a few things:
1. **Budget Settings**: Ensure your daily budget of $30 is sufficient for the bid rate and goal.
2. **Targeting**: Double-check your audience targeting settings to ensure they are not too narrow.
3. **Ad Approval**: Make sure your ads have been approved and are not pending review.
4. **Learning Phase**: If this is a new campaign, it might be in the learning phase, which can affect delivery initially.
If everything seems correct and your ads still aren't running, please reach out to adsupport@newsbreak.com for further assistance.",{}
