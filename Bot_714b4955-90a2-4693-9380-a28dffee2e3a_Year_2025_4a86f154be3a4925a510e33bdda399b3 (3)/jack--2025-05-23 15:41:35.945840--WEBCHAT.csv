bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-23 15:45:47.245494," To track your conversion event using the second ad code, you should place it in the appropriate section of your website's code. If you're using a custom code on your website, ensure it's placed correctly in the `<head>` section of your webpage. If you're using Google Tag Manager (GTM), make sure to create a new tag for the conversion event and test it using GTM's preview mode. For more detailed instructions, you can refer to our [Event Tracking Guidelines](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/14333966189581-How-to-install-a-NewsBreak-Pixel-with-GTM).

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-24 07:59:20.582797," Got it! For a custom website, make sure that the base pixel code is correctly placed in the `<head>` section of your webpage. Then, check if the custom event loads after you go through the redirects. If it's a purchase event like `complete_payment`, you'll need to make a test purchase to ensure it triggers correctly. If you're still having issues, verify if the base pixel loads correctly and check if the custom event fires as expected.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-24 08:00:27.080110," Yes, that's correct! To test a purchase event like `complete_payment`, you'll need to simulate a purchase on your own website.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-05-24 16:02:19.342067," When your ad status shows 'Warning,' it typically means there might be an issue with your ad that needs attention. This could be related to compliance with our ad policies, missing information, or technical issues. I recommend checking the details of the warning message for specific guidance on what needs to be addressed. If you need further help, feel free to contact adsupport@newsbreak.com.",{}
