bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-19 13:04:02.547264," It seems like your campaign might be in the learning phase, which typically completes after around 20-30 conversions. During this time, minimal changes should be made to allow the system to analyze performance signals and find the best audience segments. If your campaign stopped at 25 clicks, it might be due to the system trying to maintain efficiency. You can consider increasing your bid rate or switching back to Max Conversion bidding if you want more volume.
