bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-04-10 13:09:49.451708," For setting up click-to-call conversion tracking with NewsBreak on your GoHighLevel landing page, you can follow the general postback integration guide. Here are the steps to integrate a general NewsBreak Postback event for tracking clicks on call buttons:
1. **Add the Callback Parameter to Your Ad's Landing Page URL**: Insert `__CALLBACK_PARAM__` into the landing page URL of your ad.
2. **Create/Test Event**: In NewsBreak Ad Manager, go to `Tools > Event Management > Web Events`, click the `Create/test event` button, then choose `Postback` as your event tracking type.
3. **Select Tracking Service**: If you're not using a 3rd party tracking service that we already support, please choose `Others` in the tracking service field.
4. **Choose Event Type**: Select the event type you want to track (e.g., click-to-call) and if you want to track event value as well.
5. **Follow Instructions**: An instruction will show based on your inputs on the platform.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to this article: [How to integrate a general NewsBreak Postback](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/25226963388813-How-to-integrate-a-general-NewsBreak-Postback).
