{
    ""code"": 4033,
    ""errMsg"": ""invalid token""

Call is :

curl --location 'https://business.newsbreak.com/business-api/v1/campaign/getList' \

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 19:36:58.890220," It looks like you're encountering an 'invalid token' error when trying to use the API. This usually means that the access token you're using is either incorrect or expired. Here's what you can do:

1. **Verify Token**: Double-check that the token you are using is correct and hasn't been altered.

2. **Generate a New Token**: If the token is expired or invalid, you may need to generate a new one. You can do this by logging into the Newsbreak Ad Manager Platform, clicking on Tools - Resources - API Access Tokens, and then selecting 'Generate token'.

3. **Secure Your Token**: Ensure that your token is kept secure and not shared publicly.

For more detailed instructions, you can refer to our guide on fetching your API access token here: [API Integration Guide](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/27680147056397-API-Integration-Guide).",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-11 19:37:45.069169," Your curl syntax looks mostly correct, but make sure that the token is properly formatted and enclosed in quotes if necessary. Here's a revised version:

```bash
curl --location 'https://business.newsbreak.com/business-api/v1/campaign/getList' \
--header 'Access-Token: ""244916e4-5b0a-46d2-9115-23f658c5e335""'
```

Ensure that there are no extra spaces or characters in the token. If you continue to face issues, double-check the API endpoint URL and headers for any typos or errors.",{}
