bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 22:53:57.767914," Hi Daryl, yes, installing a pixel on your pages is necessary for tracking conversions and other events.

For example, Shopify or Google Tag Manager (GTM)?",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-12 22:54:50.283366," Got it, Daryl! For installing a NewsBreak Pixel on your ClickFunnels bridge page, you will need to add the pixel code to your page's header. Unfortunately, I don't have a specific guide for ClickFunnels, but the general steps are similar to other platforms. Here's a basic outline of what you need to do:
1. Copy the NewsBreak Pixel base code.
2. In ClickFunnels, go to your funnel and select the page where you want to install the pixel.
3. Click on 'Edit Page' and then go to 'Settings' > 'Tracking Code'.
4. Paste the NewsBreak Pixel base code into the header section.
5. Save your changes.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-03-13 00:05:58.986698," The Click ID is typically generated by the platform you're using for tracking, such as ClickFunnels. It may not be directly visible in NewsBreak's event management. Here’s how you can find it in ClickFunnels:
1. Log in to your ClickFunnels account.
2. Go to the funnel where you want to track the Click ID.
3. In the funnel steps, click on 'Edit Page' for the specific page you are working on.
4. Go to 'Settings' > 'Tracking Code' and look for any custom scripts that might include a Click ID parameter.
5. If you have set up tracking parameters, they should be visible within these scripts or in your URL parameters when a user clicks through your funnel.
If you're still having trouble finding it, I recommend reaching out to ClickFunnels support for more detailed assistance on locating and using the Click ID.",{}
