bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-17 14:48:31.075816," It sounds like your ads are getting seen and clicked, which is great! However, if you're not seeing conversions, there might be a few things to consider. Check if your landing page is optimized for conversions and ensure that the conversion tracking is set up correctly. You might also want to review your targeting settings to make sure you're reaching the right audience. If you need more detailed guidance, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-17 14:49:34.785867," Sure thing! To set up conversion tracking, you can use several methods like JavaScript Pixel Tracking, Google Tag Manager, or Server-to-Server (S2S) Postback. Each method has its own advantages depending on your needs. For example, JavaScript Pixel is great for real-time web-based conversions, while S2S Postback is robust for mobile and affiliate marketing. Make sure to pass unique transaction IDs to prevent duplicate conversions and always validate your setup. If you need more detailed instructions or assistance with a specific platform, let me know!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-17 14:50:40.137131," To validate your conversion tracking setup, you can follow these steps:

1. **Use the 'Go Test' Feature**: This feature allows you to test your Pixel or Postback setup. You should see a 'Test result: successful' message if everything is set up correctly.

2. **Check Event Management**: If a default Pixel or Postback event appears in Event Management, it indicates that your account has received conversion events, suggesting the setup is correct.

3. **Simulate User Actions**: Perform the action that should trigger the conversion event (e.g., complete a purchase) and check if the event is recorded.

4. **Review Debugging Steps**: Ensure that your pixel or postback is implemented correctly on your website.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-17 14:51:57.781811," When you see 'event value false,' it typically means that the event you're trying to track did not trigger successfully. This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect setup of the tracking code, issues with the event parameters, or the event not being fired correctly on your website or app. Double-check your implementation and ensure that all necessary conditions for the event to trigger are met.
