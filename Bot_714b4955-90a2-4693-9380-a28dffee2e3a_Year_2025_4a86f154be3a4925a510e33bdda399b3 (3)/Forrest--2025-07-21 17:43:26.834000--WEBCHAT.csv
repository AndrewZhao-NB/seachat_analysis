bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-21 17:48:38.431511," If your ad set is performing poorly after completing the learning phase, here are a few steps you can take to adjust:

1. **Review Your CPA**: If your actual CPA is higher than expected, consider adjusting your budget or targeting.

2. **Adjust Budget Gradually**: Increase or decrease the budget by a maximum of 30-50% each time and monitor performance for 2-3 days to gauge the impact.

3. **Optimize Ad Sets**: Keep the higher-performing ad sets active and consider pausing those that aren't performing well.

4. **Test New Creatives**: Sometimes refreshing your creative content can help improve engagement and performance.

5. **Re-evaluate Targeting**: Ensure that your targeting aligns with your audience's demographics and interests.

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-07-27 14:21:38.530245," Yes, using tCPA (Target Cost Per Acquisition) can help optimize your budget by focusing on acquiring conversions at a target cost. However, it's important to increase your daily budget gradually, about 20-30% every 2-3 days, to maintain performance stability. You can also use the bid estimation tool to identify ad sets with high growth potential and project conversion metrics based on bid rate increases.
