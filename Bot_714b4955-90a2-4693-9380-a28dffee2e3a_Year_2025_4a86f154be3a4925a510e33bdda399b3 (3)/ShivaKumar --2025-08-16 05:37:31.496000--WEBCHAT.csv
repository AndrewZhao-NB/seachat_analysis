bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-16 05:38:20.081524," Yes, through our ad platform, you can target based on user interests along with other options like location, gender, age, language, and device type. This allows you to get specific with who sees your ads. However, we generally recommend starting with broad targeting at first to help identify the users most likely to convert on your offers.",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-16 05:41:19.373362," If you're not seeing the user interest option in your ad set, make sure you're accessing the correct section within Ad Management. When creating your campaign, after selecting your objective, you should be able to build an audience based on location, gender, age, and user interest. If it's still not visible, it might be a technical issue or a setting that needs adjustment. You can refer to our guide on creating ads for more detailed steps: [How to create your first ad](https://help.newsbreak.com/hc/en-us/articles/17618196971149-How-to-create-your-first-ad).",{}
