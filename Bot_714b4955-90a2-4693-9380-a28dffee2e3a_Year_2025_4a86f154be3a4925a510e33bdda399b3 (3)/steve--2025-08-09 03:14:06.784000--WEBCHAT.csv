bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-08-10 00:08:00.246412," If your target CPA ads aren't spending the budget, there are a few things you can check without increasing your bid:

1. **Campaign Start Date**: Ensure your campaign has started and is active.
2. **Targeting Settings**: Review your audience targeting to ensure it's not too narrow.
3. **Ad Scheduling**: Make sure your ads are scheduled to run during peak hours when your target audience is most active.
4. **Ad Creativity**: Invest in visually compelling ad content that resonates with your audience.
5. **Testing**: Run A/B tests to identify which ad variations perform best before allocating more budget.
