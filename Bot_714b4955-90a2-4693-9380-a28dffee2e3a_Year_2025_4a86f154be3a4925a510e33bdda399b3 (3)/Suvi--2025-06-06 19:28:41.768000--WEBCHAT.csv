If it's not captured within this time, the payment will be canceled, and the funds will be released back to your account. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to ask!",{}

bot,WEBCHAT,BOT,BOT,2025-06-18 18:27:12.462893," I'm sorry to hear that the amount hasn't been returned yet. Since the $10 is a temporary authorization, it should be released back to your account after 7 days if not used. If it's been longer than that, I recommend reaching out to your bank for further assistance. If you need more help from our side, please email adsupport@newsbreak.com with your details.",{}
